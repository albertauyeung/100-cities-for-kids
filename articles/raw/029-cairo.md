# Cairo: The Amazing City by the Nile River

Cairo is one of the most fascinating cities in the world! If you're learning geography, you're in for a treat because Cairo has so much to discover. Let's explore this incredible Egyptian city together!

## Where in the World is Cairo?

Cairo is located in northeastern Egypt, in the continent of Africa. The city sits on the eastern bank of the famous Nile River, which is the longest river in the world! Cairo is about 165 kilometers (100 miles) south of the Mediterranean Sea and about 120 kilometers (75 miles) west of the Suez Canal[^1][^17]. If you look at a map, you'll find Cairo right where the Nile River starts to spread out into a triangle shape called the Nile Delta before reaching the Mediterranean Sea.

## How Many People Live in Cairo?

Cairo is HUGE! It's the largest city in all of Africa. The city itself has about 9.5 million people according to the 2017 census[^1], but the Greater Cairo area (which includes the main city and all the surrounding neighborhoods) has over 23 million people as of 2025[^2]. That's more than twice the population of cities like London or New York! Cairo is also one of the most densely populated places on Earth, with over 19,000 people living in each square kilometer[^10].

## The Great Pyramids - An Amazing Sight!

The most famous sight near Cairo is definitely the Great Pyramids of Giza. These enormous ancient structures were built more than 4,500 years ago as tombs for Egyptian pharaohs (kings)[^7]. The Great Pyramid is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and the only one still standing today[^10]. It was built for Pharaoh Khufu and is so big that scientists still aren't completely sure how the ancient Egyptians built it without modern machines! The Great Sphinx, a huge statue with the body of a lion and the head of a human, guards these pyramids[^7].

## What Language Do People Speak and What Do They Eat?

People in Cairo speak Egyptian Arabic in their everyday life, though the official language of Egypt is Standard Arabic[^3]. If you visit Cairo, you might hear people saying "Sabah el-kheir" which means "Good morning!"

One of the most popular foods in Cairo is koshary - a delicious dish that mixes macaroni, spaghetti, rice, lentils, chickpeas, crispy fried onions, and spicy tomato sauce all in one bowl[^8]. It's like having all your favorite ingredients in one meal! Koshary is sold everywhere in Cairo - from fancy restaurants to small street stalls where you can even get it in a plastic bag to take with you[^8].

## A Famous Musician from Cairo

Mohamed Abdel Wahab was one of Egypt's most beloved musicians and composers. Born in Cairo in 1902, he became famous for his beautiful songs about love and patriotism[^4]. He was so talented that he even composed the national anthem for Libya[^4]! One of his famous recordings was an album called "Cairo By Night," which featured traditional Egyptian instruments like the oud (similar to a guitar) and the ney (a type of flute)[^14][^20]. His music is still popular today, many years after he died in 1991.

## A Famous Scientist Born in Cairo

Did you know that Dorothy Hodgkin, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, was born in Cairo in 1910[^6]? Even though she was English, she was born in Cairo where her father worked. She became a brilliant scientist who developed ways to use X-rays to see the structure of important molecules in our bodies. Her discoveries helped scientists understand how medicines work and helped create new treatments for diseases[^6]. She won the Nobel Prize in 1964, which is like winning an Olympic gold medal in science!

## A Famous Writer from Cairo

Naguib Mahfouz was a famous writer born in Cairo in 1911. He wrote many stories and novels about life in Egypt and became the first Arabic writer ever to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1988[^9]. His most famous work is called "The Cairo Trilogy," which tells the story of three generations of an Egyptian family living in Cairo from World War I until the 1950s[^9]. Through his stories, readers around the world learned about Egyptian culture and daily life.

## Fun Facts About Cairo

Did you know that Cairo's name in Arabic is "Al-Qahirah," which means "The Victorious"[^1]? The old part of Cairo is so special that it's protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site[^10].

Another fun fact: Cairo has the largest food court in the world[^10]! So if you're hungry, you'd have plenty of choices!

Cairo is also one of the oldest cities in the world with people living in the area for thousands of years. The city itself was founded in 969 CE, which means it's over 1,000 years old[^17]!

Now that you know about Cairo, maybe someday you'll get to visit this amazing city and try some koshary while looking at the ancient pyramids and thinking about all the famous people who once walked its streets!
