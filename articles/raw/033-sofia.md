# Sofia: The Amazing Capital of Bulgaria

Sofia is the exciting capital city of Bulgaria, with a history going back thousands of years! Today, it's a modern city where old buildings and new ones stand side by side. If you're learning about world geography, Sofia is definitely a place worth knowing about. It's filled with beautiful churches, delicious foods, and has been home to many important people who have changed the world with their ideas and creations.

## Where is Sofia?

Sofia sits in a special valley called the Sofia Valley, at the foot of a mountain called Vitosha[^1]. It's located in the western part of Bulgaria, near the center of a region called the Balkans. What makes Sofia's location really neat is that it sits almost exactly in the middle between two seas - the Black Sea and the Adriatic Sea[^1][^17]. It's also one of the highest capital cities in Europe! In fact, it's the second highest capital city in the European Union (after Madrid, Spain) and the third highest in all of Europe[^1].

Unlike many capital cities that are built along big rivers, Sofia doesn't have a major river running through it[^1]. Instead, it has several smaller rivers that cross through the city. The city is surrounded by beautiful mountains that you can see from almost anywhere in town.

## Amazing Places to See

The most incredible building in Sofia is the Saint Alexander Nevsky Cathedral. This massive church is one of Sofia's most important landmarks and a place that almost all tourists want to visit[^8]. It was built between 1904 and 1912 in a style called Neo-Byzantine, which means it looks a bit like ancient churches from long ago[^8].

The cathedral is HUGE! It can hold 5,000 people inside at once and is one of the 50 largest Christian church buildings in the entire world[^8]. It's also the largest cathedral in an area called the Balkans. When you step inside, you can look up at its beautiful domes that rise high above your head. The main dome reaches 46.3 meters high (that's about as tall as a 15-story building)[^8]!

## The People of Sofia

About 1,286,000 people live in Sofia as of 2025[^11]. That's a lot of people! To help you imagine how many that is, think about filling about 17,000 school buses with people - that's roughly how many people live in Sofia! The city is home to about 17.9% of Bulgaria's total population, which means about 1 out of every 6 Bulgarians lives in or around Sofia[^1].

In recent years, Sofia's population has been pretty stable, with just a tiny decrease of about 0.16% from 2024 to 2025[^11]. This means that almost the same number of people live there now as did last year.

## Bulgarian Language and Yummy Foods

People in Sofia speak Bulgarian, which uses a special alphabet called Cyrillic[^3]. Some simple Bulgarian phrases you might want to learn are "Здрасти" (pronounced "zdrasti"), which means "Hello," and "благодаря" (pronounced "blagodarya"), which means "Thank you"[^3].

Here's something funny: Bulgarians shake their heads differently than people in most other countries! When they mean "yes," they shake their heads from side to side (which is how many people indicate "no"). And when they mean "no," they nod up and down (which is how many people usually say "yes")[^3]. This could get confusing if you visit!

Bulgarian food is delicious! One popular dish is Shopska Salad, which has tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and a special Bulgarian white cheese called sirene[^4]. The salad has the same colors as the Bulgarian flag - white, green, and red! Another tasty treat is Banitsa, a cheesy pastry that many Bulgarians eat for breakfast[^4]. They also love grilled meats called Kebapche, which are like small sausages made from beef and pork with special spices[^4].

## Famous People from Sofia

### A Musical Master

Triphon Silyanovski was an important composer and pianist who was born right here in Sofia on December 16, 1923[^6]. He was very talented and studied both music and law! He was a wonderful piano player and won the first Bulgarian Singers' and Instrumentalists' Competition[^6]. Triphon composed many different kinds of music including symphonies (music for a whole orchestra) and music for piano. His music often included special melodies that sounded like traditional Orthodox church songs[^6].

### A Brilliant Scientist

Georgi Nadjakov was a famous Bulgarian physicist who lived in Sofia[^9]. He was so smart and made such important discoveries that he was invited to be a member of science academies in Bulgaria, Germany, and Russia[^9]! His biggest achievement was discovering something called a "photoelectret" in 1937[^9]. This might sound complicated, but his discovery actually helped lead to the invention of something you probably see almost every day - the photocopier! That's right, when your teacher makes copies of worksheets, they're using technology that came from Georgi Nadjakov's work[^9].

### A Creative Writer

Lyuben Dilov Jr. was born in Sofia on November 19, 1964[^7]. He studied journalism at Sofia University and became a writer, journalist, and even a film director! He has created many popular TV shows in Bulgaria and has written many stories[^7]. He's also been involved in politics in his country. His father, Lyuben Dilov, was also a famous Bulgarian writer, so writing talent runs in the family[^7]!

## Fun Facts About Sofia

Did you know that Sofia has 49 mineral and thermal springs right in the city[^1]? These are like natural hot tubs where warm water comes up from deep underground. Some people believe the water has special healing powers.

Another fun fact is that sunflower and pumpkin seeds are super popular snacks in Bulgaria[^4]. If you visit Sofia, you'll see many people snacking on handfuls of seeds in parks and other outdoor spaces. It's such a common sight that it's considered part of Bulgarian culture!

Sofia is also one of the oldest cities in Europe - people have been living in the area for at least 9,000 years[^1]. That's way before the pyramids in Egypt were built!

The next time you look at a map of Europe, remember to find Sofia in Bulgaria - a city with amazing history, tasty food, smart people, and lots of mineral springs!
