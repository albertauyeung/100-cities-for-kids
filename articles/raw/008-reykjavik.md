# Discover Reykjavik: Iceland's Cool Capital City!

Reykjavik is a fascinating city filled with colorful buildings, interesting people, and stunning natural surroundings. As Iceland's capital and largest city, it has so much to offer for curious young explorers!

## Where in the World is Reykjavik?

Reykjavik is located in the northwestern part of Iceland, sitting on the shores of Faxaflói bay. Did you know it's the northernmost capital city in the world? That means it's farther north than any other country's main city[^2]. The city covers about 200 square kilometers of land, which is plenty of space for its residents[^1].

## How Many People Live There?

In 2025, about 142,116 people call Reykjavik home[^1]. That might sound like a lot, but compared to many other capital cities around the world, Reykjavik is actually quite small and cozy. People from over 100 different countries live in Reykjavik, making it a diverse and interesting place[^1].

## What Language Do They Speak and What Do They Eat?

People in Reykjavik speak Icelandic (pronounced "ist-len-ska"), which is one of the oldest languages in Europe[^3]. It's pretty special because it hasn't changed much over the centuries!

When it comes to food, Reykjavik has amazing food halls where you can try lots of different dishes. One popular food hall is called Hlemmur Mathöll where you can find everything from Icelandic lamb to tasty tacos and even Italian ice cream[^4]. Yum!

## The Most Famous Landmark

If you visit Reykjavik, you can't miss Hallgrimskirkja! This huge church stands 74.5 meters tall and can be seen from all over the city[^5]. Its design was inspired by Iceland's basalt rock formations, making it look like something out of a fairy tale. You can even climb to the top for an amazing view of the colorful city below!

## A Famous Musician from Reykjavik

Have you ever heard of Björk? She was born in Reykjavik and is one of the most famous Icelandic musicians in the world[^6]. She's been making music since the 1970s and is known for her unique singing style and creative songs. Björk has traveled all over the world sharing her special Icelandic talent!

## A Brilliant Scientist

Kári Stefánsson is an important scientist from Reykjavik who studies human genetics[^9]. He founded a company called deCODE genetics right in Reykjavik[^12]. His work helps scientists understand why people get certain diseases and might one day lead to new medicines. Kári is so good at his job that he's considered one of the most influential scientists in the whole world[^11][^12]!

## Fun Fact

Here's something surprising: Reykjavik is the only capital city in Europe that doesn't have a McDonald's or a Starbucks[^8]! Instead, they have their own unique restaurants and coffee shops. But don't worry - if you really want fast food, they do have KFC and Taco Bell!

Reykjavik might be small, but it's packed with history, culture, and friendly people. Maybe someday you'll get to visit this amazing northern city!
