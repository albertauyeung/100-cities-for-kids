# Hong Kong: The Amazing City by the Sea

Hong Kong is a fascinating city located in Eastern Asia, right at the mouth of the Pearl River Delta and bordering the South China Sea. It is a special administrative region (SAR) of China and shares a land border with the Chinese mainland, just north of the large city of Shenzhen.

Hong Kong is made up of three main parts: Hong Kong Island, Kowloon Peninsula, and the New Territories, plus more than 260 smaller islands. Most of the land is hilly or mountainous, with the highest point being Tai Mo Shan at 957 meters (3,140 feet).

## Where All the People Live

About 7.7 million people live in Hong Kong as of 2024, making it one of the most crowded places in the world. Even though it is about six times the size of Washington, D.C., or half the size of Mauritius, so many people live there that the city is packed with tall buildings and busy streets. The heart of Hong Kong is the urban area around Victoria (on Hong Kong Island) and Kowloon, which are filled with dazzling skyscrapers, especially beautiful when lit up at night.

## Languages and Yummy Food

Most people in Hong Kong speak Cantonese, a Chinese language common in southern China, but English is also an official language due to Hong Kong's history as a British colony. The city is famous for its delicious food, especially dim sum—small, tasty dishes served in bamboo steamers that you can share with family and friends!

## A Special Place to Visit: Tai Kwun

Tai Kwun is a remarkable cultural landmark in Central, Hong Kong, housed in the beautifully restored former Central Police Station compound. It brings together three declared monuments: the Central Police Station, Central Magistracy, and Victoria Prison, all thoughtfully revitalized to preserve their historical significance. Today, Tai Kwun serves as a dynamic hub for heritage, art exhibitions, and performing arts, offering interactive experiences for visitors of all ages. Children can explore old prison cells, learn about Hong Kong’s colonial past, and enjoy hands-on art and cultural workshops. The site also hosts regular festivals and community events, making it a lively and inclusive space to experience Hong Kong’s unique blend of East and West. Tai Kwun’s commitment to local culture and history, combined with its modern art and community spirit, makes it one of the most culturally representative places to visit in the city.

## A Famous Musician: Kajeng Wong, Pianist

Hong Kong is home to many talented musicians, and one of the most well-known is Kajeng Wong. Born in Hong Kong in 1990, Kajeng started playing the piano at the age of seven and quickly became a star in local music competitions. He has won top prizes at international piano competitions, such as the Alaska International Piano E-Competition and the Maria Canals International Piano Competition. Kajeng has performed in famous concert halls around the world, representing Hong Kong on the global stage.

He is also known for his creativity and originality in music, often mixing classical pieces with new ideas and working with other artists in dance and theater. A documentary about his life, called “KJ: Music \& Life,” even won the Best Documentary award at the Golden Horse Awards. Kajeng Wong continues to inspire young musicians and music lovers in Hong Kong and beyond with his exciting performances and passion for music.

## A Brilliant Scientist: Sir Charles Kao

Have you ever wondered how the internet works? A scientist from Hong Kong named Sir Charles Kao helped make it possible! Known as the "father of fiber optic communications," he discovered how to send light through thin glass fibers, which allows information to travel around the world in just seconds. For his amazing discovery, he won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009. Thanks to his work, we can now easily connect with people across the globe!
