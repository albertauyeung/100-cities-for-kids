# Lima: The City of Kings

Lima is the capital and largest city of Peru, a country in South America. This amazing city sits between the Pacific Ocean and the Andes Mountains, in a desert zone where three rivers meet - the Chillón, Rímac, and Lurín. Even though Lima is only about 8 miles (13 kilometers) from the ocean, it sits 500 feet (152 meters) above sea level[^1][^6].

## Where Everyone Lives

More than 10 million people call Lima home! That's almost one-third of Peru's entire population. This makes Lima the most populated city in Peru and the second most populous city in all of the Americas, after São Paulo in Brazil[^5][^6]. If you visited Lima, you would meet people from many different backgrounds, as the city is a melting pot of cultures from all over the world[^7].

## Languages and Yummy Food

In Lima, most people speak Spanish - about 80% of the population uses it as their first language. Some people also speak Quechua, which is an indigenous language of Peru[^7].

Lima is known as the "Gastronomical Capital of the Americas" because of its amazing food! The most famous dish is ceviche, which is Peru's national dish made from raw fish marinated in lime juice with salt, garlic, onions, and hot peppers[^2]. In 2023, a restaurant in Lima called Central was named the Best Restaurant in the World[^2]!

## Magic Water Park

One of the coolest places to visit in Lima is the Magic Water Circuit (Circuito Mágico del Agua). This amazing park has colorful fountains that dance to music and light shows. It's like watching water perform magic tricks! Kids love running through some of the fountains on hot days[^7].

## A Famous Musician

Lima has many talented musicians! One of them is Greccia, a singer-songwriter who makes Dream pop, urban alternative, and R\&B music. In 2024, she released her first album called "devut" and was named Spotify's Radar Andes Artist of the Year[^3]. Her music is helping put Lima on the global music map!

## A Potato Scientist

Carlos Ochoa was an important scientist who worked at the International Potato Center in Lima. He was like the "Indiana Jones" of potatoes! He went on dangerous expeditions high in the Andes Mountains to find wild potato species that no one knew about before. Thanks to his work, scientists can now make better potato varieties that can resist diseases and grow in difficult conditions[^4]. He helped make sure people around the world can enjoy potatoes!

## Fun Fact

Here's something surprising: Lima has black vultures called "gallinazos" that help clean up the city! In 2016, the city even put GoPro cameras and GPS trackers on some of these birds to help find places where people were illegally dumping trash. These vultures are like flying environmental helpers![^5]

Lima truly is an amazing city with rich history, delicious food, and fascinating people. Maybe someday you can visit the City of Kings yourself!
