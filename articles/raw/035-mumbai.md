# Mumbai: India's Amazing City of Dreams

Mumbai is one of India's most exciting and bustling cities, often called the "City of Dreams" because so many people come there to follow their dreams! This incredible city has a fascinating history, amazing food, and is home to some very famous people. Let's explore what makes Mumbai so special.

## Where is Mumbai Located?

Mumbai is located on the western coast of India, right next to the beautiful Arabian Sea[^1]. The city sits in the state of Maharashtra and is built on what used to be seven separate islands[^1]! Can you imagine that? Long ago, clever engineers connected these islands together using land reclamation projects, which means they filled in the water between the islands to create one big city[^1]. Mumbai lies on a narrow peninsula called Salsette Island, with the Arabian Sea to the west, Thane Creek to the east, and Vasai Creek to the north[^1].

The city coordinates are approximately 19°04′34″N and 72°52′39″E, which means it's in the northern hemisphere and quite far east[^1]. Mumbai is about 875 miles away from India's capital city, New Delhi[^15].

## A Special Place to Visit: The Gateway of India

One of the most famous and beautiful places to visit in Mumbai is the Gateway of India[^5]. This magnificent arch monument looks like a giant stone doorway standing proudly by the sea! It was built in 1924 to celebrate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary, who were the King and Queen of England at that time[^5][^16].

The Gateway of India is 26 meters (85 feet) tall and is made of yellow basalt stone[^5][^16]. It was designed in a special style called Indo-Saracenic, which mixes Indian, Islamic, and British architectural styles together[^16]. The monument has beautiful carved stone work called "jaali" and four impressive turrets[^16]. When you stand there, you can see boats and ships sailing on the Arabian Sea, and it's a perfect spot for taking pictures[^5]!

What makes this place even more special is that it was the last place where British soldiers left India when the country became independent in 1948[^5]. Today, it's one of Mumbai's top tourist attractions and locals love to gather there[^20].

## How Many People Live in Mumbai?

Mumbai is incredibly crowded – it's home to about 12.5 million people in the city itself, making it the most populous city in India[^1]! But if you count all the surrounding areas (called the Mumbai Metropolitan Region), there are over 22 million people living there[^3]. That's more people than in many entire countries!

To put this in perspective, Mumbai is the fourth most populous city in the entire world[^3]. Every year, about 415,900 more people move to Mumbai, which means the city keeps growing bigger and bigger[^3]. Many people come from other parts of India looking for jobs and better opportunities[^3].

## What Languages Do People Speak?

In Mumbai, people speak many different languages! The official language is Marathi, which is spoken by about 42% of the people[^4]. Hindi is the second most common language, spoken by around 30% of the population, and Gujarati is spoken by about 19% of residents[^4].

But here's something really cool – Mumbai has its own special way of speaking called "Bambaiya" or "Mumbaiya"! This is a fun mix of Hindi, Marathi, and English words all put together[^4]. It's like the city's own secret language that locals love to use when talking to each other.

Mumbai is home to people from all over India, so you can hear over 16 major languages being spoken there[^4]. This makes Mumbai a very colorful and diverse place where many different cultures come together.

## Delicious Mumbai Food

Mumbai has some absolutely delicious street food that's famous all over India! The most popular snack is called "vada pav," which is sometimes called the "Bombay burger"[^7]. It's a tasty deep-fried potato ball (called vada) stuffed inside a bread roll (called pav), served with spicy chutneys and a green chili[^7]. This yummy snack was invented in Mumbai in the 1960s for mill workers who needed something quick and cheap to eat[^7].

Another famous Mumbai dish is "pav bhaji," which is a thick, spicy vegetable curry served with buttered bread rolls[^8]. The curry is made with mashed potatoes, onions, carrots, peas, and tomatoes, all cooked together with special spices[^8]. Street vendors cook it on flat griddles right in front of you, and it smells absolutely amazing[^8]!

Both of these foods started as quick meals for busy workers but became so popular that now you can find them in restaurants all over India and even in other countries[^7][^8].

## A Famous Musician: Zakir Hussain

Mumbai was the birthplace of one of the world's greatest tabla players, Zakir Hussain[^9]. The tabla is a pair of drums used in Indian classical music, and Zakir Hussain was considered the best tabla player of his generation[^9]!

He was born in Mumbai (then called Bombay) on March 9, 1951, and his father, Alla Rakha, was also a very famous tabla player[^9]. Zakir started learning music when he was just seven years old – that's probably around your age or maybe younger! He began performing in concerts at age seven and was touring by the time he was twelve[^9].

What made Zakir Hussain extra special was that he brought Indian classical music to people all around the world[^9]. He won four Grammy Awards, which are very important prizes for musicians[^9]. He could play so fast that one newspaper said "the blur of his fingers rivals the beat of a hummingbird's wings"[^9]! He passed away in December 2024, but his beautiful music will be remembered forever.

## A Famous Scientist: Homi J. Bhabha

Mumbai was also home to Dr. Homi J. Bhabha, who is known as the "father of the Indian nuclear programme"[^10]. Dr. Bhabha was a brilliant nuclear physicist, which means he studied atoms and nuclear energy – the same kind of energy that powers the sun!

Dr. Bhabha was born on October 30, 1909, and lived until January 24, 1966[^10]. He played a very important role in helping India develop its own nuclear research program and become more advanced in science and technology. After he died, a very important research center in Mumbai was renamed the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in his honor[^10].

He also helped start many other research institutes and encouraged research in electronics, space science, and radio astronomy[^10]. Thanks to his work, India built one of the world's largest radio telescopes! Dr. Bhabha believed that science could help make India a better and more modern country.

## A Famous Writer: Salman Rushdie

One of the world's most famous authors, Salman Rushdie, was born and raised in Mumbai[^11]. He wrote a very important book called "Midnight's Children" in 1981, which tells the story of India around the time the country became independent[^11].

Salman Rushdie lived in Mumbai until he was 13 years old, in a house called Windsor Villa on Warden Road[^11]. He had to leave Mumbai when his parents sent him to school in England, but he never forgot his childhood home. The memories of Mumbai and the stories he heard there became very important in his writing[^11].

In "Midnight's Children," Rushdie used many of his memories and experiences from Mumbai to create a magical story about India's history. The book became famous all over the world and won many important prizes. Even though he lives in other countries now, Rushdie says Mumbai will always be his true home, and the city continues to inspire his writing.
