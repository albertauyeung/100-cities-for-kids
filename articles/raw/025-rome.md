# Rome: The Eternal City of Italy

Rome is one of the most famous and historic cities in the world! Located in central Italy, this amazing city has thousands of years of history and fascinating things to discover. Let's explore the wonderful city of Rome together!

## Where in the World is Rome?

Rome is located in the central part of Italy, in a region called Lazio. If you look at a map, you'll find Rome at these coordinates: 41.9028° North, 12.4964° East[^1][^2]. The city sits on the banks of the Tiber River, which flows right through the middle of Rome[^2][^11].

One interesting geographic fact is that Rome was built on seven hills! These hills are called the Aventine Hill, Capitoline Hill, Viminal Hill, Palatine Hill, Quirinal Hill, Esquiline Hill, and Caelian Hill[^1]. Rome is not directly on the sea, but it's less than 20 miles from the Tyrrhenian Sea, which is part of the Mediterranean[^1].

## The Amazing Colosseum

If you visit Rome, one place you absolutely must see is the Colosseum! This massive ancient building is one of the most famous structures in the world[^8][^9].

The Colosseum is a giant amphitheater (like a stadium) that was built nearly 2,000 years ago, between 70 and 80 CE[^9]. It's huge! When it was being used in ancient times, it could hold between 50,000 and 80,000 people[^8]. That's as many people as can fit in some modern football stadiums!

In ancient Rome, the Colosseum was used for exciting (but often violent) entertainment, including gladiator fights and mock naval battles when they would flood the arena with water[^8][^9]. Today, the Colosseum is partly ruined due to earthquakes and stone robbers over the centuries, but it's still an incredible sight and one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions[^8].

## How Many People Live in Rome?

Rome is a big city! In fact, it's the largest and most populous city in all of Italy[^15][^17]. As of 2025, approximately 2.75 million people live in the city of Rome itself[^15][^17]. If you count all the surrounding areas (the metropolitan area), that number grows to about 4.3 million people[^3][^12].

The population of Rome has been growing slowly in recent years. Between 2024 and 2025, the population increased by 0.35%[^12].

## What Language Do Romans Speak and What Do They Eat?

People in Rome speak Italian, which is the official language of Italy. In ancient times, people in Rome spoke Latin, which is actually the language that Italian eventually developed from[^4].

Rome is famous for its delicious food! One of the most important elements of Roman cuisine is pasta. Some famous Roman pasta dishes include:

* Cacio e pepe: pasta with cheese and black pepper
* Carbonara: pasta with eggs, cheese, and guanciale (a type of bacon)
* Amatriciana: pasta with tomato sauce and guanciale
* Gricia: pasta with guanciale and cheese[^5]

Romans also enjoy other tasty foods like zucchini flowers filled with mozzarella and anchovies, which are battered and deep-fried. For dessert or on a hot day, you might try grattachecca, which is a type of shaved ice treat that's popular in Rome[^5].

## A Famous Musician from Rome

One of the most famous musicians born in Rome was Ennio Morricone. He was born in Rome on November 10, 1928, and became one of the greatest music composers in the world[^6].

Morricone was especially famous for creating music for movies. He wrote more than 400 scores for films and television shows[^6]! You might not know his name, but you've probably heard his music in famous movies. He won many awards for his music, including two Academy Awards (Oscars) and three Grammy Awards[^6].

## A Brilliant Roman Scientist

Rome was also the birthplace of Enrico Fermi, one of the most important scientists of the 20th century. He was born in Rome on September 29, 1901[^7].

Fermi was a physicist who made incredible discoveries about atoms and nuclear energy. He created the world's first artificial nuclear reactor, which was a huge scientific achievement[^7]. For his amazing work, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1938[^7].

Fermi's discoveries helped scientists understand how atoms work and eventually led to developments in nuclear energy. He was so important that element number 100 in the periodic table is named "fermium" after him!

## Fun Facts About Rome

Here are some fun facts about Rome that might surprise you:

* Rome is often called the "Eternal City" because it's so old and has survived for thousands of years[^11].
* The legend says that Rome was founded in 753 BC by Romulus, who was supposedly raised by a wolf[^11]!
* Vatican City, which is located entirely within Rome, is actually the smallest country in the world[^14]!
* Rome has more fountains than any other city in the world - over 2,000 of them!
* People throw about €1 million worth of coins into the famous Trevi Fountain each year. This money is collected and used to help people in need.
