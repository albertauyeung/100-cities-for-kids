Osaka is situated in the Kansai region of Japan on the island of Honshu. It lies along the Yodo River and faces Osaka Bay, making it an important port city historically[^5]. The city’s location has made it a hub for trade and commerce since ancient times. During the 7th and 8th centuries, Osaka was known as Naniwa and served as the capital of Japan[^8].
