# Discovering Vilnius, Lithuania

**Main Takeaway:** Vilnius is the colorful capital of Lithuania, nestled where two rivers meet, with a medieval Old Town, tasty traditional dishes, and home to famous artists, scientists, and writers who helped shape Europe.

## Where Is Vilnius?

Vilnius lies in northeastern Europe, in a country called Lithuania. On a map, find the Baltic Sea (the long sea up north), then look southeast to spot Lithuania. The city of Vilnius was first mentioned in writing in **1323**, and today it sits at the meeting point of the **Neris** and **Vilnia** rivers, surrounded by gentle hills and green parks.

## A Special Sightseeing Spot: Gediminas’ Tower

At the heart of Vilnius’s Old Town stands **Gediminas’ Tower**, the red-brick remnant of a 15th-century castle.

- Built by Grand Duke Vytautas and later rebuilt many times, the tower once had four stories and even served as a prison and an optical telegraph station under Russian rule.[^1]
- Climb its wooden stairs to reach the viewing platform—kids love spotting the winding cobblestone streets below and imagining medieval knights defending the castle walls.
- Every January 1st, the Lithuanian tricolor flag is raised here, symbolizing the country’s road to independence.[^1]


## Population: How Many People Live There?

- As of 2025, about **541,517** people live in the Vilnius urban area, making it the largest city in Lithuania and the second-largest in the Baltic states after Moscow’s suburbs.[^2]
- Over the last 75 years, Vilnius has more than doubled its population—from around 222,000 in 1950 to over half a million today.[^2]


## Language and Food

- **Language:** The people of Vilnius speak **Lithuanian**, one of the oldest living Indo-European languages. It uses a 32-letter Latin alphabet and has seven noun cases, which means word endings change to show who did what in a sentence.[^3]
- **Food:** Traditional Lithuanian dishes are hearty and warming. Try:
    - **Cepelinai** (“zeppelins”): large potato dumplings stuffed with meat or cheese, served with sour cream and crispy bacon bits.
    - **Kugelis**: a baked potato pudding flavored with onions and bacon, often eaten with a dollop of sour cream.
    - **Šaltibarščiai**: a bright pink cold beet soup, perfect for summer days.


## Famous Musician: Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis

- **Who he was:** Born in 1875, Čiurlionis was both a composer and a painter—sometimes called Lithuania’s national treasure. In just ten years, he created around 400 musical works (mostly for piano) and painted about 300 artworks that blend music and dreams.[^4]
- **What he did:**
    - Wrote two famous symphonic poems, **In the Forest** (1901–1902) and **The Sea** (1907), still performed today.
    - Painted cycles like **The Zodiac** and **Sonata of the Sun**, giving musical titles to his colorful landscapes.
    - Helped found the Lithuanian Art Society in Vilnius and started its first competition for local composers.


## Famous Scientist: Marija Gimbutienė

- **Who she was:** Marija Gimbutienė (1921–1994) grew up near Vilnius and became an archaeologist and anthropologist. She studied prehistoric European people and published the **“Kurgan hypothesis,”** which suggests the first Indo-European speakers came from the Eurasian steppes.[^5]
- **What she did:**
    - Led excavations in Europe—uncovering ancient pottery, tools, and temple remains from 7,000 to 2,500 BCE.
    - Wrote **The Civilization of the Goddess** (1991), showing how early farming societies worshiped a female deity.
    - Inspired later archaeologists to combine mythology and folklore with scientific digs—a method she called **archaeomythology**.


## Famous Writer: Czesław Miłosz

- **Who he was:** Born in 1911 near Vilnius, Czesław Miłosz grew up wandering the city’s Baroque streets. He became a poet, translator, and diplomat, writing mainly in Polish.
- **What he did:**
    - Described wartime experiences and moral questions in works like **The Captive Mind** (1953), revealing life under Soviet rule.
    - Won the **1980 Nobel Prize in Literature** for poems that “voice man’s exposed condition in a world of severe conflicts”.[^6]
    - Taught at the University of California, Berkeley, introducing Slavic literature to students around the world.


## Fun Facts About Vilnius

- **Medieval Marvel:** Vilnius’s Old Town is one of Europe’s largest medieval centers and a **UNESCO World Heritage Site**, with over 1,500 historic buildings, churches, and hidden courtyards.
- **“Jerusalem of the North”:** In the late 1800s, nearly 40% of the city’s residents were Jewish, giving Vilnius this nickname. Today, you can explore the restored Great Synagogue and nearby museums.
- **Green Capital:** In 2025, Vilnius earned the title **European Green Capital** for its parks, bike lanes, and clean-energy initiatives.
