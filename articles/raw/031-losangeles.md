# Los Angeles: The City of Angels

Do you want to visit a city filled with movie stars, sunny beaches, and towering mountains? Let's take a trip to Los Angeles, one of the most exciting cities in the United States! Los Angeles, often called L.A. for short, is a place where dreams come true and adventures await around every corner.

## Where in the World is Los Angeles?

Los Angeles sits in southern California, right next to the beautiful Pacific Ocean. It's the second-largest city in the United States, after New York City[^1]. The city is mainly built in a desert basin, surrounded by magnificent mountains including the San Gabriel Mountains and divided by the Santa Monica Mountains[^17].

Los Angeles is huge! It covers about 502.7 square miles - that's almost 470 square miles of land and 34 square miles of water[^19]. If you wanted to travel from the northernmost part of L.A. to the southernmost part, you'd need to go 44 miles (71 kilometers), and from east to west, it's 29 miles (47 kilometers)[^19]. Los Angeles County (the larger area that includes the city) has 75 miles of beautiful coastline where you can swim, surf, and build sandcastles[^17].

## The Famous Hollywood Sign

One of the most special places to visit in Los Angeles is the Hollywood Sign. This giant sign sits on Mount Lee in the Santa Monica Mountains and is one of the most famous landmarks in the whole world[^13]!

The sign is enormous - each letter is 45 feet tall (about as high as a 4-story building), and the whole sign stretches 450 feet long[^13]. That's longer than a football field! Originally built in 1923, it actually said "HOLLYWOODLAND" and was just an advertisement for new houses being built in the area[^13]. In 1949, they removed the "LAND" part, and in 1978, they rebuilt the entire sign to make it stronger[^13].

Today, millions of people visit Los Angeles just to take pictures with this iconic sign in the background[^18]. You can see it from many places in the city, but some of the best views are from Griffith Observatory or the Hollywood \& Highland shopping center[^16].

## The People of Los Angeles

Los Angeles is home to lots and lots of people! About 3.8 million people live within the city limits as of 2023[^11]. That makes it the second most populous city in the United States[^1]. But the greater Los Angeles area (which includes nearby cities) is even bigger, with about 12.9 million people calling it home[^11]. That's more people than in many entire countries!

## Languages and Food

One amazing thing about Los Angeles is how many different languages you can hear while walking down the street. While most people speak English, over half of the city's population also speaks Spanish[^3]. You can also hear people speaking Mandarin Chinese, Korean, Tagalog (from the Philippines), Armenian, and Persian (also called Farsi)[^3].

When it comes to food, Los Angeles has lots of delicious things to try! One famous food from L.A. is the Cobb Salad, which was invented at the Hollywood Brown Derby restaurant[^4]. Los Angeles is also home to the very first In-N-Out Burger, which opened in 1948[^9]. This famous burger restaurant started as a tiny stand (only 100 square feet!) where people could order food without leaving their cars - one of the first drive-thru restaurants in California[^9].

## A Famous Musician from Los Angeles

John Cage, an important composer of modern classical music, was born in Los Angeles in 1912[^6]. Although he started by taking piano lessons as a child, writing was actually his first passion. After traveling to Europe and hearing the music of composers like Johann Sebastian Bach, he was inspired to create his own music[^6].

John studied with a famous teacher named Arnold Schoenburg, who only agreed to teach him if John promised to devote his entire life to music - and he did[^6]! John Cage became known for creating very unusual and experimental music that changed how people think about sound. Sometimes his music even included silence as an important part of the composition!

## A Famous Scientist from Los Angeles

Ellen Ochoa is an amazing scientist and astronaut who was born in Los Angeles in 1958[^7]. After studying electrical engineering at Stanford University, she worked as a research engineer and helped invent several important systems that received patents (special documents that show you invented something new)[^7].

In 1993, Ellen made history by becoming the first Hispanic woman ever to travel into space[^7]! She flew on four space missions in total. Later, from 2013 to 2018, she was the director of NASA's Johnson Space Center, helping to run America's space program[^7]. In 2024, she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest honors an American citizen can receive[^7].

## A Famous Writer from Los Angeles

James Ellroy is a well-known crime fiction writer who was born in Los Angeles in 1948[^8]. He writes exciting mystery books that often take place in Los Angeles. Two of his most famous books are "The Black Dahlia" and "L.A. Confidential," which was later made into a popular movie[^8].

James has a very unique writing style. He often uses short, quick sentences that make you feel like you're right in the middle of the action[^8]. His stories about Los Angeles have helped readers from all over the world imagine what life in this exciting city is like.

## Fun Facts About Los Angeles

Did you know that Los Angeles used to have a super long name? The original Spanish name was "El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora Reina de los Ángeles sobre el Río Porciúncula," which means "The Town of Our Lady Queen of the Angels on the Porciúncula River"[^14]. That's quite a mouthful! No wonder they shortened it to "Los Angeles"!

Here's another cool fact: Los Angeles is home to the La Brea Tar Pits, which have the largest collection of Ice Age fossils in the world[^10]. Scientists have found more than 3.5 million fossils there, including sabre-toothed cats and giant sloth skeletons. There's even a mummified baby mammoth[^10]!

Did you know there are 91 abandoned tunnels under the streets of Los Angeles[^10]? If you put them all together, they would stretch for about 17 kilometers (about 11 miles)[^14]. Many of these tunnels were used during the 1920s when alcohol was banned in America. People would use the tunnels to visit secret underground parties[^10]!

One more interesting fact: Los Angeles has the largest Thai population outside of Thailand - over 80,000 Thai people live there[^10]!

Los Angeles is truly a special city with something for everyone. From its beautiful beaches to its towering mountains, from Hollywood stars to amazing scientists and artists, it's a place where exciting things happen every day. Maybe someday you'll get to visit this wonderful City of Angels!
