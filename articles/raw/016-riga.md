# Discovering Riga: Latvia's Wonderful Capital City

Riga is the capital city of Latvia, a beautiful country in Northern Europe. It's a place filled with history, amazing buildings, and friendly people. Let's explore this fascinating city together!

## Where in the World is Riga?

Riga sits on both banks of the Daugava River, just 9 miles (15 km) from where the river meets the Gulf of Riga and the Baltic Sea[^10]. If you look at a map of Europe, you'll find Latvia nestled between Estonia and Lithuania, with Riga located near Latvia's coast. The city is so important that about one-third of the entire country's population lives there[^1]!

## How Many People Live in Riga?

As of 2024, about 605,273 people call Riga their home[^1]. That's a lot of people! In fact, Riga accounts for about one-third of Latvia's total population. The city's population has changed over time – it was much bigger in the late 1980s with over 900,000 people, but has gotten a bit smaller since then[^1].

## The Amazing Old Town

One of the most special places to visit in Riga is its Old Town. This area is so historically important that it's protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site[^1]! In the Old Town, you can visit the Lutheran cathedral, which is the largest church in all the Baltic states[^3]. The streets are often made of cobblestones, and many buildings have stood there for hundreds of years since the city was founded in 1201[^1]. Walking through the Old Town is like stepping back in time!

## What Language Do People Speak and What Do They Eat?

The official language of Latvia is Latvian[^4]. When people greet each other in Riga, they might say "Sveiki!" which means "Hello!" in Latvian.

Latvian food is delicious! Traditional Latvian restaurants like "Tam Labam Būs Augt" (which means "Good Things Will Grow") serve tasty local dishes[^5]. Latvians enjoy foods made with locally-grown ingredients, and their cooking combines traditional recipes with modern cooking styles. If you visited Riga, you might try dishes featuring fish, potatoes, meat, and fresh vegetables from nearby farms.

## A Famous Musician from Riga

Riga has been home to many talented musicians. One of the most important is Jāzeps Vītols, who lived from 1863 to 1948[^8][^12]. After Latvia became independent in 1918, Vītols helped establish the country's National Opera and founded the Latvian Conservatory of Music (which is now named after him!)[^8]. One of his most famous compositions is called "Gaismas pils" (Castle of Light), which is still performed by huge choirs in Latvia today[^8].

## A Brilliant Scientist from Riga

Andris Ambainis is an amazing scientist who works at the University of Latvia in Riga[^7][^11]. He studies something very complex and futuristic called quantum computing! This science uses the strange laws of physics at the tiny atomic level to solve problems much faster than regular computers can[^17]. Andris is so good at his work that he was the first Latvian scientist to receive a special grant from the European Research Council to continue his research[^17]. He's like a real-life science superhero!

## Fun Facts about Riga

Did you know that Riga has one of the largest collections of Art Nouveau buildings in the world? There are at least 800 of these beautiful buildings with decorative facades featuring flowing lines, flowers, and faces[^1].

Here's another cool fact: The radio and TV tower in Riga is the tallest structure in all the Baltic States! It reaches an impressive 368.5 meters (about 1,209 feet) high[^1].

Riga has also hosted exciting international events like the Eurovision Song Contest in 2003 and several Ice Hockey World Championships[^1].

Next time you're learning about European capitals, remember Riga – the beautiful, historic city where old traditions and modern life come together in a wonderful way!
