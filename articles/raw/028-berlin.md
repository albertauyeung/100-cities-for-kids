# Discovering Berlin: Germany's Amazing Capital City!

Berlin is one of the most exciting cities in the world, full of history, culture, and fun things to see and do! As Germany's capital city, Berlin has something special around every corner. Let's explore this amazing place together and discover what makes it so special.

## Where is Berlin Located?

Berlin sits right in the heart of Europe, in the northeastern part of Germany. The city is built along the banks of the Spree River, which flows right through the center of the city[^12]. If you look at a map, you'll find Berlin about 112 miles (180 km) south of the Baltic Sea and 55 miles (89 km) west of Poland[^12]. The city covers an area of about 891 square kilometers, which is pretty big[^2]!

The city is surrounded by the state of Brandenburg, almost like an island in the middle of this region[^1]. Berlin lies in a wide glacial valley, which means the land was shaped by glaciers (giant ice sheets) a very long time ago[^12].

## The Amazing Brandenburg Gate

If you visit Berlin, you absolutely must see the Brandenburg Gate! This huge monument is one of Germany's most famous landmarks[^9]. Built between 1788 and 1791 (that's over 230 years ago!), it looks like an ancient Greek temple with beautiful columns and a magnificent bronze sculpture of a chariot with four horses on top[^9].

The Brandenburg Gate has seen much of Berlin's history. During the Cold War, the Berlin Wall was built right next to it, and for many years, people couldn't freely walk through it. But now it stands as a symbol of peace and the unity of Germany[^9]. When you stand in front of it, you'll feel like you're looking at a page from your history book come to life!

## The People of Berlin

Berlin is the largest city in Germany by population. About 3.7 million people call Berlin home, making it the most populous city in the European Union[^1]. In December 2024, it's estimated that nearly 3.9 million people will be living there[^1]. That's a lot of people!

The people who live in Berlin are called "Berliners." If you visited, you might hear them call themselves "Berliner" (if they're a man) or "Berlinerin" (if they're a woman)[^1].

## How Berliners Talk and What They Eat

In Berlin, people speak German, but they have their own special way of talking called "Berlin German" or "Berlinese." Locals sometimes call it "Berlinerisch" or "Berlinisch." It's a special dialect with unique phrases and pronunciations that make Berliners sound different from people in other parts of Germany[^10].

When it comes to food, Berlin has a special treat called Currywurst! This delicious dish was invented in Berlin in 1949 by a woman named Herta Heuwer. It's a pork sausage covered with a special sauce made from ketchup and curry powder[^7]. It's so popular that Germans eat about 800 million currywursts every year, with 70 million of them being eaten in Berlin alone[^7]! It's usually served with french fries or a bread roll, and you can find it at food stands all over the city.

## Paul Lincke: Berlin's Music Master

Berlin has been home to many great musicians, but one of the most special is Paul Lincke, who was born in Berlin on November 7, 1866[^3]. He is known as the "father of the Berlin operetta," which is a type of musical play[^3].

Paul Lincke wrote many beautiful pieces of music, but his most famous work is called "Berliner Luft" ("Berlin Air"), which has become the unofficial anthem of Berlin[^3]. If you visited Berlin during a festival or celebration, you might hear this song being played! He also composed another famous piece called "The Glow-Worm"[^3]. Paul Lincke was so important to Berlin that they even named a street after him - the Paul-Lincke-Ufer, which runs along the Landwehr Canal[^13].

## Alexander von Humboldt: Berlin's Brilliant Scientist

Alexander von Humboldt was born in Berlin on September 14, 1769, and became one of the greatest scientists of his time[^4]. He was an explorer and naturalist who traveled all around the world studying plants, animals, rocks, and the weather.

One of Humboldt's most amazing adventures was his trip to Latin America, which lasted from 1799 to 1804[^4]. During this journey, he collected thousands of plant specimens that were new to European scientists. He also climbed volcanoes, mapped rivers, and studied the stars.

After returning to Berlin, Humboldt gave famous lectures called the "Kosmos lectures" at Berlin University, sharing all he had learned about our planet[^4]. His work was so important that many places around the world are named after him, including the Humboldt Current in the Pacific Ocean!

## Judith Kerr: The Storyteller from Berlin

Judith Kerr was born in Berlin on June 14, 1923[^5]. When she was a young girl, her family had to leave Germany because of the rise of the Nazis, and they eventually settled in Britain[^5].

Judith became a wonderful author and illustrator whose books have sold more than 10 million copies worldwide[^5]! You might have heard of her famous children's book, "The Tiger Who Came to Tea," about a friendly tiger who visits a little girl and her mother and eats all their food[^5]. She also wrote a series of books about a cat named Mog.

One of her most important books is called "When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit," which tells the story of her own childhood escape from Nazi Germany[^5]. Through her books, Judith helped children understand difficult parts of history in a way that was meaningful to them.

## Fun Facts About Berlin

Did you know that Berlin has more bridges than Venice, Italy? It's true! While Venice has about 400 bridges, Berlin has an amazing 2,100 bridges[^6]! That's because Berlin has lots of rivers, canals, and lakes running through it.

Another cool fact is that Berlin is the greenest city in Europe[^8]! About one-third of the entire city is made up of parks, forests, and gardens[^8]. So even though it's a big city, there are plenty of beautiful green spaces where people can relax and enjoy nature.

Berlin is also home to the tallest building in Germany - the Berlin TV Tower, which stands 368 meters tall[^6]. If you went to the top, you could see the whole city spread out below you!

And here's something really interesting - Berlin has more waterways than either Venice or Amsterdam, which are both famous for their canals[^8]. There are about 180 kilometers of waterways flowing through Berlin!

## Wrap Up

Berlin is truly a fascinating city with an incredible history, amazing landmarks, and talented people. From the magnificent Brandenburg Gate to delicious currywurst, from the beautiful music of Paul Lincke to the exciting stories of Judith Kerr, Berlin has contributed so much to our world. Maybe someday you'll get to visit this wonderful city and explore all its treasures for yourself!
