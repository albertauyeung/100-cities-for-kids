# Edinburgh: Scotland's Magical Capital City

Edinburgh is a fascinating city with ancient castles, extinct volcanoes, and many amazing stories to discover! As Scotland's capital city, Edinburgh is full of history, culture, and exciting places to explore. Let's take a journey through this wonderful city and discover what makes it so special.

## Where Is Edinburgh?

Edinburgh is located in southeast Scotland, in the United Kingdom. The city is built along the southern shore of a large inlet of the North Sea called the Firth of Forth. To the south of the city are the beautiful Pentland Hills. Edinburgh sits in the Scottish Lowlands, which means it's in the less mountainous part of Scotland, but the city itself is quite hilly with many ups and downs as you walk around it[^1][^10].

Unlike many flat cities, Edinburgh was built around and on top of hills and even extinct volcanoes! This gives the city a unique appearance with buildings rising up at different levels, creating a dramatic skyline that looks like something from a storybook[^10].

## Edinburgh Castle: A Fortress on a Volcano

The most amazing sight in Edinburgh has to be Edinburgh Castle! This enormous castle sits high above the city on top of Castle Rock, which is actually a 700-million-year-old extinct volcano[^6][^11]. From its position 443 feet (135 meters) above sea level, the castle looks down over the entire city, making it look like something from a fairy tale[^19].

People have lived on Castle Rock for at least 3,000 years! The first king to make his home here was King Malcolm III, who lived in the castle more than 900 years ago. The castle contains St. Margaret's Chapel, built between 1130 and 1140, which is the oldest building in all of Edinburgh that's still standing today[^19].

Edinburgh Castle has seen a lot of exciting history - it's the most besieged place in Britain, having been attacked 23 times throughout history[^5][^11]! Today, more than two million visitors come to see the castle every year[^14].

## The People of Edinburgh

Edinburgh is home to more than 514,000 people as of 2022[^2]. The city has become increasingly diverse over the years. While most residents are Scottish, many people from all over the world now call Edinburgh home.

In 2022, about 85% of Edinburgh's population was White (including Scottish, British, Irish, Polish and other European backgrounds), with growing Asian, Black, Mixed and other ethnic communities making up about 15% of the population[^1]. The city has changed a lot over time - in 1991, about 98% of the population was White, showing how Edinburgh has become more diverse and multicultural in recent decades[^1].

## Language and Food

The main language spoken in Edinburgh is English, which is the official language of Scotland. However, you might also hear Scottish Gaelic (pronounced "GAL-ik") and Scots, which are historical languages of Scotland that some people still speak today[^3].

Edinburgh has lots of delicious traditional foods to try! Some favorites include:

- Fish and Chips: Deep-fried cod or haddock with French fries, usually served with salt and vinegar
- Haggis with "neeps and tatties": A traditional Scottish dish made with sheep's meat, oats and spices, served with mashed turnips and potatoes
- Scotch Eggs: A hardboiled egg wrapped in spiced meat, then breaded and fried
- Macaroni Pie: Macaroni and cheese baked in a pastry shell - yum![^4]


## Famous People from Edinburgh

### A Classical Composer: Thea Musgrave

Edinburgh has been home to many great musicians. One important composer born in Edinburgh is Thea Musgrave. Born in the Barnton area of Edinburgh, she first went to Edinburgh University to study medicine but changed to music instead. Thea has composed over a dozen operas (musical plays where the story is sung) including "Mary, Queen of Scots" and many works for orchestras including "Loch Ness - A Postcard from Scotland." Even in her 90s, she continued to compose music![^15]

### A Brilliant Scientist: James Clerk Maxwell

One of the world's most important scientists was born in Edinburgh on June 13, 1831. His name was James Clerk Maxwell, and he made incredible discoveries about electricity, magnetism, and light. His work helped us understand that electricity and magnetism are connected, and that light is a type of electromagnetic wave.

Scientists consider Maxwell to be as important as Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein! His ideas led to many modern inventions like radio, television, and even your cell phone. Without Maxwell's discoveries about electromagnetic waves, none of these technologies would exist[^9].

## Fun Facts About Edinburgh

Did you know that Edinburgh is the greenest city in the United Kingdom? It has 112 parks and more trees per person than any other city in the UK[^6].

Edinburgh Zoo is home to the world's only knighted penguin! His name is Sir Nils Olav, and he even inspects the Norwegian Guard when they visit Edinburgh[^6].

J.K. Rowling wrote much of the Harry Potter books while living in Edinburgh. Many places in the city inspired locations in the books - Victoria Street in Edinburgh is thought to have inspired Diagon Alley, and she wrote parts of the books in a coffee shop called The Elephant House[^6].

The Royal Mile, a famous street in Edinburgh, isn't exactly a mile long - it's actually one mile and 107 yards![^6]

Edinburgh has a volcano right in the middle of the city called Arthur's Seat. Some people believe it might have been the location of Camelot, the legendary castle of King Arthur[^7].

Edinburgh is truly a magical city filled with history, science, music, and fascinating stories around every corner. Whether you're interested in ancient castles, volcanic mountains, delicious food, or famous people who changed the world, Edinburgh has something exciting for everyone to discover!
