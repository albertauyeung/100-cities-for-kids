# Exploring Copenhagen: Denmark's Wonderful Capital City

Copenhagen is the vibrant capital city of Denmark. This colorful city sits on the eastern shore of an island called Zealand. If you look at a map, you'll find Copenhagen facing the Øresund Strait, which is the body of water that separates Denmark from its neighbor, Sweden. The Swedish city of Malmö is just on the other side, and the two cities are connected by a huge bridge[^9].

## A Magical Place to Visit: Tivoli Gardens

If you visit Copenhagen, you must see Tivoli Gardens! This is one of the oldest amusement parks in the whole world, having been founded all the way back in 1843. What makes Tivoli Gardens extra special is that it inspired both the famous fairy tale writer Hans Christian Andersen and Walt Disney, who got ideas for Disneyland after visiting here[^2]. The park has beautiful gardens, exciting rides, and magical decorations that change with the seasons[^2][^7].

## The People of Copenhagen

About 1.4 million people live in Copenhagen today[^3]. The city keeps growing each year! If you visited Copenhagen, you would notice people from many different backgrounds. While most residents are Danish, people from all over the world have made Copenhagen their home[^9].

## Language and Yummy Foods

People in Copenhagen speak Danish. If you visit, you might want to learn simple Danish words like "hej" (hello) and "tak" (thank you). Copenhagen is also famous for its delicious food! One popular Danish dish is called "smørrebrød" - an open-faced sandwich made with rye bread and topped with things like fish, meat, or cheese[^4]. Danes also love "flæskesteg" - a crispy pork roast sandwich that's perfect for a picnic in one of the city's beautiful parks[^4].

## A Famous Musician: Carl Nielsen

Carl Nielsen is Denmark's most famous classical composer. He was born in 1865 on the Danish island of Funen but spent much of his life in Copenhagen, where he died in 1931[^15]. Nielsen wrote beautiful music including six symphonies (big pieces for orchestra) and many songs that Danish people consider part of their national heritage[^15][^5]. He even worked as the director of the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen just before he died[^13].

## A Brilliant Scientist: Niels Bohr

Copenhagen was home to Niels Bohr, one of the world's most important scientists. Bohr was a physicist who founded the Institute for Theoretical Physics (now called the Niels Bohr Institute) in 1921[^6]. His work helped explain how atoms work - the tiny particles that make up everything around us! Scientists from all over Europe would visit Copenhagen just to talk with Bohr about physics and new discoveries[^6].

## Fun Fact About Copenhagen

Did you know there are more bicycles than cars in Copenhagen?[^7] That's right! The people of Copenhagen love to ride bikes, and the city has special bike lanes everywhere. It's one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world. So many people cycling instead of driving cars helps keep the air clean and the people healthy!

Copenhagen truly is a special place where history, culture, science, and fun all come together in one beautiful city by the sea.
