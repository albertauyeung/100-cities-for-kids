# Lisbon: The Sunny Capital of Portugal

Lisbon is a fascinating city with so much to discover! It's the capital and largest city of Portugal, and it's filled with colorful buildings, delicious food, and lots of history. Let's explore this amazing place together!

## Where is Lisbon?

Lisbon is located in western Portugal, sitting on the northern shore of the Tagus River where it meets the Atlantic Ocean. It's actually the westernmost capital city on the European mainland - that means if you traveled directly west from Lisbon across the ocean, the next land you'd hit would be America![^1][^9] The city is built on seven steep hills, which gives it beautiful views but can make walking around quite a workout!

## Population

About 567,131 people live in the city center of Lisbon as of 2023, which is about the same as a medium-sized city in many countries. But when you include all the surrounding areas that make up Greater Lisbon, there are nearly 3 million people living there - that's almost 30% of Portugal's entire population![^1][^10] The city is growing again after years of people moving to the suburbs, with more people choosing to live in the historic center.

## The Amazing Belém Tower

One of the most special places to visit in Lisbon is the Belém Tower. This beautiful tower was built between 1514 and 1520 to help defend the city from attacks by sea. It sits right at the edge of the Tagus River and looks like something from a fairy tale![^4][^12]

The tower has five floors connected by a narrow spiral staircase, and from the top, you can see amazing views of the river and city. One fun thing to look for is a stone carving of a rhinoceros on the outside of the tower. This rhino was carved after the first real rhinoceros arrived in Portugal from India in 1513![^12]

Today, the Belém Tower is so important that UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site, which means it's considered a treasure for all of humanity to protect and enjoy.[^16]

## Language and Food

In Lisbon, people speak Portuguese as their main language. If you visited, you might hear people saying "Olá" (hello) or "Obrigado/Obrigada" (thank you). Don't worry if you don't speak Portuguese though - many people in Lisbon, especially younger people and those working in restaurants, hotels, and tourist attractions, speak very good English![^3][^15]

Portuguese food is delicious! Lisbon is famous for its seafood, especially codfish (bacalhau), which they prepare in over 365 different ways - that's a different cod recipe for every day of the year! They also love grilled sardines, especially during summer festivals. For dessert, you must try pastéis de nata, which are yummy egg custard tarts with crispy pastry.[^6]

## A Famous Musician: Carlos Seixas

Lisbon has been home to many talented musicians throughout history. One of the most important was Carlos Seixas, who lived from 1704 to 1742. He was a musical genius who could play both the organ and the harpsichord (an instrument that looks like a piano) amazingly well. He was so talented that he became an organist at a cathedral when he was only 14 years old! Later, he moved to Lisbon where he played music for the king of Portugal at the royal palace.[^7]

## A Brilliant Scientist: Pedro Nunes

Pedro Nunes was a remarkable mathematician and scientist who lived from 1502 to 1578. At a time when Portugal was sending ships to explore the world, Nunes created new mathematical tools to help with navigation. He was the first person to come up with the idea of a loxodrome (a special line on a map that helps sailors navigate). He also invented measuring tools including one called the "nonius" that helped make more precise measurements. His inventions helped Portuguese explorers sail more safely across the oceans![^8]

## Fun Facts About Lisbon

Did you know that Lisbon is considered the sunniest capital city in Europe? It gets around 2,800 hours of sunshine per year![^14]

One of the best ways to explore Lisbon is by riding on Tram 28. This famous yellow tram was built in England in the early 1900s and rattles and clanks up and down the steep hills of the city, squeezing through narrow streets where cars can't go.[^5]

The symbol of Lisbon is a raven! According to an old legend, two ravens traveled with the body of Saint Vincent (the patron saint of Lisbon) when it was brought to the city in 1173. You can see these two ravens on Lisbon's official coat of arms.[^13]

Here's something super secretive: the original recipe for Lisbon's famous custard tarts (pastéis de nata) is known to only about five people in the whole world! These people never travel together in the same car or plane, and they never order the same dish at restaurants - all to protect the secret recipe![^13]

Lisbon is truly a magical city with its colorful houses, historic castles, delicious food, and friendly people. Maybe one day you'll get to visit and see all these wonderful things for yourself!
