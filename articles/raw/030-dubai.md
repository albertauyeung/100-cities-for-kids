# Discovering Dubai: The Amazing City in the Desert

Dubai is one of the most incredible cities in the world! Located in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), this fascinating place has transformed from a small desert town to a futuristic metropolis in just a few decades. Let's explore this amazing city and discover what makes it so special!

## Where in the World is Dubai?

Dubai is located in the Middle East, on the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula along the Persian Gulf[^1][^17]. It is one of the seven emirates (like states or provinces) that make up the country called the United Arab Emirates[^1]. If you look at a map, you'll find Dubai on the northeastern part of the Arabian Peninsula, surrounded by desert with beautiful beaches along the Persian Gulf[^15][^17].

Dubai shares borders with Abu Dhabi (the capital of UAE) to the south and Sharjah to the northeast[^1]. The city is positioned at approximately 25.26° north latitude and 55.29° east longitude[^1]. Even though Dubai is so famous that some people think it's a country, it's actually just one city (and emirate) within the UAE[^15].

## The Burj Khalifa: Touching the Sky!

The most amazing sight in Dubai has to be the Burj Khalifa - the tallest building in the entire world![^12]. This incredible skyscraper stands an astonishing 828 meters (2,717 feet) tall and has 163 floors[^12][^18]. That's almost like stacking three Empire State Buildings on top of each other!

The Burj Khalifa was completed in 2010 and is shaped a bit like the letter Y when viewed from above[^18]. This special design helps it withstand strong desert winds[^18]. Inside, you'll find homes, offices, a luxury hotel, and two observation decks where visitors can see spectacular views of the entire city and beyond[^18][^20].

The spire at the top of the building is so tall that it had to be built inside the tower and then carefully lifted into place using special equipment[^18]. Can you imagine being on the 124th or 148th floor observation decks? On a clear day, you can see for over 90 kilometers (55 miles) in all directions![^12][^18]

## The People of Dubai

Dubai is home to around 3.8 million people as of 2025, making it the most populous city in the UAE[^1][^2]. Here's something fascinating: more than 90% of the people living in Dubai are expatriates, which means they came from other countries to live and work there[^1]. This makes Dubai one of the most diverse cities in the world!

The population has grown incredibly fast over the years. In 1980, only about 270,000 people lived in Dubai. By 2015, it had grown to 2.38 million, and now it's over 3.8 million[^2]. That's like adding more than 10 people every hour for 45 years!

## Languages and Delicious Food

### Languages

Arabic is the official language of Dubai, but because so many people from different countries live there, you'll hear many languages being spoken[^3]. There are two main types of Arabic used in Dubai:

1. Modern Standard Arabic - used for official documents, news, and formal situations
2. Spoken Arabic - used in everyday conversations and comes in different dialects[^3]

English is very widely spoken and understood throughout Dubai, making it easy for tourists to visit[^3]. You'll find that most road signs, menus, and information boards are written in both Arabic and English[^3].

### Tasty Treats

Dubai has some amazing foods that you should try if you ever visit:

* **Khameer bread** - A special flatbread that looks like a burger bun but is sweetened with dates and sprinkled with sesame seeds[^8]
* **Luqaimat** - Delicious sweet dumplings that are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, dipped in date syrup and sprinkled with sesame seeds[^8]
* **Camel milk chocolate** - A unique treat that you can only find in a few places in the world! It's made with milk from camels instead of cows[^8]
* **Mint lemonade** - A super refreshing drink that's perfect for hot desert days[^8]


## A Musical Star: Ihab Darwish

Dubai is home to some amazing artists, including Ihab Darwish, a talented Emirati composer who has been playing music since he was just 10 years old[^7]. He creates beautiful classical music with orchestra performances.

In 2018, Darwish released his first album called "Waves of My Life" which was performed by an orchestra of more than 140 musicians[^7]. What makes this special is that it was the first complete orchestral work by an Emirati composer!

In 2020, he composed the official musical theme "Aim For The Sky" for The Palm Fountain in Dubai, which is the world's largest fountain according to the Guinness Book of World Records[^7]. His music combines traditional Arabic sounds with modern classical music, creating something truly unique.

## A Brilliant Scientist: Dr. Ahmed Almheiri

Dubai is also proud of Dr. Ahmed Almheiri, a brilliant physicist who studies black holes in space[^9]. He won the prestigious 2021 New Horizons in Physics Prize for his amazing research on black holes and quantum information[^9].

Dr. Almheiri is the first Emirati to become a Post-doctoral Scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton University, which is one of the most prestigious research centers in the world[^9]. He was honored by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (the ruler of Dubai) for being "a source of pride for the whole Arab world"[^9]. His work helps scientists understand the mysteries of our universe!

## A Talented Writer: Dubai Abulhoul

Dubai Abulhoul is a remarkable Emirati author who has published five books since 2012[^10]. What's really impressive is that she started very young! When she was just 11 years old, she created an animated film called "Galagolia" and was named the Youngest Director of the Middle East[^10].

In 2012, she published a fantasy novel called "Galagolia: The Hidden Divination"[^10]. She's not just an author but also writes columns for newspapers and founded the Fiker Institute, which is a think tank that helps study global affairs and governance[^10]. She's an inspiration to young writers everywhere!

## Fun Facts About Dubai

* Dubai has created several artificial islands in the sea, including Palm Jumeirah, which is shaped like a palm tree and can be seen from space![^5]
* The Dubai Mall is one of the largest shopping malls in the world, with over 1,200 shops and it received a record 105 million visitors in 2023[^6]
* There's a luxury penthouse in the Burj Khalifa that is currently for sale for \$51 million! It spans 21,000 square feet and has its own indoor swimming pool[^4]
* Dubai has the second-most five-star hotels in the world, after only London[^1]
* In Dubai, you can actually try a camel burger! It's called a "hump burger" and is made from camel meat that has been specially prepared to be tender and tasty[^8]
* Even though Dubai looks ultra-modern, it was only in the early 20th century that it started developing into the global hub it is today[^1]


## Conclusion

With its incredible buildings, diverse population, rich culture, and talented people, it's a place where imagination becomes reality.
