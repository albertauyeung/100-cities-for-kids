# Discovering Prague: A Journey to the Heart of Europe

Prague is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic, a country located right in the middle of Europe. People often call Prague the "Heart of Europe" because it sits almost in the center of the continent! The city is built along the beautiful Vltava river and is famous for its colorful buildings and historic bridges.

## Where Exactly is Prague?

Prague is located in the western part of the Czech Republic in an area called Bohemia. If you look at a map, you'll see that the Czech Republic is surrounded by other countries including Germany, Poland, Slovakia, and Austria. Interestingly, Prague is actually located further west than Vienna, Austria!

## How Many People Live There?

In 2025, about 1.35 million people call Prague their home. That's about the same as having 13 football stadiums completely filled with people! The city spans about 298 square kilometers (115 square miles), and people live quite close together with around 4,600 residents in each square kilometer.

## Amazing Sight to See: Prague Castle

If you visit Prague, you absolutely must see Prague Castle! Did you know it holds a Guinness World Record for being the largest castle in the world? It covers a massive area of 18 acres - that's bigger than 13 football fields put together[^9]! Inside the castle grounds, you'll find beautiful buildings, gardens, and the magnificent St. Vitus Cathedral. The castle sits on a hill overlooking the entire city, giving you spectacular views of Prague's red rooftops and church spires.

## Language in Prague

People in Prague speak Czech (pronounced "Check"), which they call "čeština" in their language. Czech is considered one of the most difficult languages to learn because it has many unusual sounds and complicated grammar rules. The language developed back in the 14th century and has a fascinating history. But don't worry if you visit - many people in Prague, especially in places tourists visit, can speak English too!

## Delicious Czech Foods

Czech food is perfect for hungry explorers! One of the most famous Czech dishes is "Hovězí guláš" (beef goulash), which is tender beef cooked slowly with lots of onions and spices. Czechs also love "Svíčková na smetaně," a special dish of meat in a creamy vegetable sauce served with fluffy bread dumplings. When visiting Prague, you might also try "Rajská omáčka," a sweet tomato gravy often served with beef and dumplings. These hearty meals will give you plenty of energy for sightseeing!

## A Famous Musician from Prague: Antonín Dvořák

Prague has been home to many wonderful musicians, but one of the most famous is Antonín Dvořák (pronounced "DVOR-zhahk"). He was born near Prague in 1841 and became one of the most celebrated composers in the world[^10][^15]. His most famous piece of music is called the "New World Symphony," which he wrote while living in America for three years. Dvořák loved to include sounds and melodies from his Czech homeland in his music. He was so talented that even as a young boy, he played violin in his father's inn and in local churches. Today, you can visit a museum in Prague dedicated to Dvořák and learn all about his amazing music[^7][^10].

## A Brilliant Scientist from Prague: Albert Einstein

Did you know that the famous scientist Albert Einstein once lived in Prague? In 1911, when Einstein was 32 years old, he moved to Prague with his wife and two sons and stayed for 16 months[^16]. During this time, he was a professor at Prague's university and worked on his famous theory of relativity[^5][^14]. Einstein loved walking around Prague and especially enjoyed crossing the bridges over the Vltava River. He once described Prague as "so beautiful that it deserves a longer visit in itself"[^5]. Today, you can see plaques on buildings where Einstein lived and worked, and even follow the same route he took to walk to his office each day!

## A Fun Fact About Prague

Here's something amazing about Prague that most people don't know: people in Prague drink more beer per capita than any other nation in the world! Locals consume about 150 liters of beer per person each year[^9]. That's a lot of beer! The Czech Republic is famous for inventing Pilsner beer in 1842, and Prague has many breweries where this golden beverage is made. Of course, kids in Prague drink delicious fruit juices and water instead!
