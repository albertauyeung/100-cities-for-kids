# Singapore: A Tiny Island with Big Wonders

Singapore is a small island city-state located in Southeast Asia, right at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. Even though it's one of the 20 smallest countries in the world, Singapore is packed with amazing things to see and do!

## Where Is It?

Singapore sits just 85 miles north of the Equator and consists of one main diamond-shaped island plus about 60 tiny islets. It's separated from Malaysia by the Straits of Johor to the north and from Indonesia by the Singapore Strait to the south.

## How Many People Live There?

As of 2025, about 6.4 million people call Singapore home. That's a lot of people for such a small space!

## A Must-See Place: Marina Bay Sands

If you visit Singapore, you can't miss the amazing Marina Bay Sands. This incredible building has three tall towers with a boat-shaped "SkyPark" sitting on top! The SkyPark has the world's largest infinity swimming pool that seems to drop off into the sky. From up there, you can see the whole city spread out below you.

## Languages and Yummy Food

People in Singapore speak four official languages: English, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. They also speak a fifth unofficial language called Singlish, which is a fun mix of all these languages.

Singapore has delicious food! Their national dish is Chilli crab, which is tasty crab cooked in a spicy-sweet sauce. There are also lots of noodle dishes like Char kway teow and Hokkien mee that you might want to try.

## A Famous Singer

Stefanie Sun is one of Singapore's most famous singers. She's a superstar who sings beautiful songs in Mandarin Chinese and has fans all over Asia.

## An Amazing Scientist in Computer Science

Professor Luke Ong is a famous computer scientist from Singapore who is currently the Chief Scientist for AI Singapore. He works on artificial intelligence (AI) and helps develop smart technologies for Singapore and beyond. Professor Ong is known for inventing "game semantics," which helps computers understand programming languages better. His research also improves cybersecurity and makes computer programs smarter and more reliable.

## Fun Fact

Did you know that chewing gum is banned in Singapore? That's right - you can only chew gum if you have a doctor's note saying you need it for medical reasons. So don't pack any bubble gum if you're planning to visit!

Singapore may be small, but it's full of amazing buildings, delicious food, and super smart people. It's like a whole exciting world packed onto one tiny island!
