# London: A Magical City for Young Explorers

London is the exciting capital city of England and the United Kingdom. Sitting in the southeast of England on the River Thames (pronounced "Temz"), this bustling city is packed with history, culture, and fascinating sights that would make any young explorer's eyes widen with wonder!

## Where is London?

London is located in the southeast part of England on the River Thames. The river flows right through the middle of the city, dividing it into north and south parts. Long ago, people chose this spot to build London because it was the lowest point where they could build a bridge across the Thames[^1][^9]. The city has grown over thousands of years from a small Roman settlement to one of the world's most important cities today!

## How Many People Live in London?

London is HUGE! It's the largest city in the United Kingdom with about 9.8 million people living there in 2025[^2]. That's more people than in many entire countries! Greater London covers an area of about 611 square miles (1,583 square kilometers)[^12]. If you were to visit, you'd be one of millions of tourists who explore this amazing city each year.

## Amazing Places to See: The London Eye

If you visit London, you must take a ride on the London Eye! This massive Ferris wheel sits right on the south bank of the River Thames and offers spectacular views of the city. It took seven years to build and opened to visitors in 2000[^16]. During your 30-minute ride in one of the glass pods, you can see famous landmarks like Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, and St. Paul's Cathedral from high above the city[^3]. On a clear day, you can see as far as 25 miles away – that's like being able to spot something from one side of a small country to the other!

## Language and Food

People in London speak English, but you might notice they have a different accent than what you're used to hearing. London is also home to people from all over the world, so you can hear many different languages when walking down its streets.

When it comes to food, London has lots of traditional British dishes you should try! Fish and chips is a favorite – crispy battered fish served with thick-cut chips (what Americans call fries). Did you know the first fish and chips shop in the UK opened in London in the 1860s?[^8] Other tasty treats include sausage rolls, scotch eggs (hard-boiled eggs wrapped in sausage meat and breadcrumbs), and shepherd's pie (minced meat topped with mashed potatoes)[^11]. For dessert, you might enjoy millionaire's shortbread or a traditional scone with jam and cream!

## Famous Musician: Henry Purcell

London has been home to many famous musicians throughout history. One of the most important classical composers from London was Henry Purcell. Born in Westminster (a part of London) in 1659, Purcell became a very talented musician and composer[^5]. He wrote the first English opera and created music for kings and queens! He was also the organist at Westminster Abbey, a magnificent church where British kings and queens are crowned. Although he died young at just 36 years old, his beautiful music is still played in concerts around the world today[^5].

## Famous Scientist: Michael Faraday

Michael Faraday was a brilliant scientist who was born in London in 1791. What makes his story even more amazing is that he had very little formal education but became one of history's most influential scientists[^6]! Faraday made groundbreaking discoveries about electricity and magnetism. He invented the electric motor and figured out that magnetism could affect light rays. His work with electromagnetic fields helped lead to the development of the electric technology we use every day[^6]. Without Faraday's discoveries, we wouldn't have many of the electrical devices you use, like computers, phones, and televisions!

## Fun Facts About London

Did you know that London is home to the world's smallest public statue? It shows two tiny mice fighting over a piece of cheese and is halfway up a building! You have to look very carefully to spot it[^14].

Another cool fact: The famous clock tower that many people call "Big Ben" isn't actually named Big Ben at all! Big Ben is actually just the name of the huge bell inside the tower that makes the famous "bong" sound[^14][^15].

London is also considered the world's largest urban forest! Despite being a big city, it has so many trees that it's officially classified as a forest[^15].

The London Underground (called "the Tube" by locals) is the oldest underground railway system in the world! It opened in 1863 and now has 11 lines covering 402 kilometers with 272 stations. More than 5 million people use it every day[^13].

## Explore London!

London is an amazing place full of history, culture, and excitement. From riding on double-decker red buses to watching the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, there's so much for young explorers to discover. Maybe one day you'll get to visit this wonderful city and see all these amazing sights for yourself!
