# Stockholm: Sweden's Amazing Island City!

Stockholm is a beautiful city that sits on a collection of islands in Sweden. It's the capital and largest city of Sweden, located in Northern Europe. Stockholm is a special place with lots of fascinating history, delicious food, and exciting things to see and do!

## Where in the World is Stockholm?

Stockholm is located in Sweden, which is part of Scandinavia in Northern Europe. The city sits at a special spot where Lake Mälaren meets the Baltic Sea. What makes Stockholm super cool is that it's built across 14 different islands that are all connected by 57 bridges[^7]! The exact location of Stockholm is 59.334591° north and 18.063240° east on your globe or map[^1]. This unique island layout gives Stockholm the nickname "Beauty on Water."

## How Many People Live There?

In 2025, about 1.7 million people call Stockholm home[^2]. This makes it the largest city in Sweden. The city has grown a lot over time - back in 1950, only about 741,082 people lived there[^2]. Today, Stockholm is busy and lively with people from all over Sweden and many other countries too!

## The Amazing Vasa Museum

If you visit Stockholm, you absolutely must see the Vasa Museum! This is one of the coolest museums in all of Scandinavia[^7]. Inside is a giant 17th-century warship called the Vasa that sank in 1628 on its very first voyage - before it even left Stockholm's harbor![^3][^7]

The most amazing part? After sitting underwater for 333 years, scientists found the ship and brought it back up to the surface[^7]. Now you can see this massive wooden ship up close, along with exhibitions showing what life was like for sailors in the 1600s. You can even see skeletons of some of the crew members and learn about what they ate and wore[^3].

## Swedish Language and Tasty Food

In Stockholm, people speak Swedish. If you visit, you might hear people saying "Hej" (pronounced "hey"), which means "hello"!

Sweden's most famous food is Swedish meatballs, called "köttbullar" in Swedish[^4]. These tasty meatballs are made from beef and pork mixed with special spices like nutmeg and allspice[^4]. They're usually served with creamy gravy, mashed potatoes, lingonberries (which are a bit like cranberries), and pickled cucumber[^4]. It's a delicious meal that many Swedish children love!

## Famous People from Stockholm

When Alfred Nobel died, he left his money to create the Nobel Prizes, which are still given today to people who make amazing discoveries or do important work to help the world[^6]. Maybe someday you could win a Nobel Prize!
