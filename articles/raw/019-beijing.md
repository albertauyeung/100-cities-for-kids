## Beijing: An Exciting City in China

Beijing is a fascinating city with a long history, amazing sights, and lots of fun things to discover. Let’s explore this city together!

**Where is Beijing?**

Beijing is the capital city of China, which is in eastern Asia. The city is located on a flat plain in the northeastern part of the country, between two rivers. It is surrounded by mountains on three sides and is close to the famous Great Wall of China[^5][^6][^7].

**How Many People Live There?**

Beijing is one of the largest cities in the world! More than 21 million people live there, making it the world’s most populous national capital city[^7][^13]. That’s about the same as the entire population of Australia!

**What Language Do People Speak?**

The main language spoken in Beijing is Mandarin Chinese, which is also called *Putonghua*. The way people speak in Beijing is called the Beijing dialect, and it is the standard for Mandarin in all of China[^10][^13]. If you want to say “Hello!” in Mandarin, you can say “Ni hao!”[^10]

**What Is the Food Like?**

Beijing is famous for its delicious food. The most famous dish is *Peking duck*, a special roasted duck with crispy skin that people eat with pancakes, spring onions, and a sweet sauce[^13]. People in Beijing also love snacks like *Fuling jiabing* (a type of pancake), and you’ll find lots of street food stalls selling tasty treats[^14]. Many meals include rice, noodles, vegetables, and sometimes meat or tofu, and people often eat with chopsticks[^10].

**A Special Place to Visit: The Forbidden City**

One of the most amazing places in Beijing is the Forbidden City. This huge palace was built in the 1400s and was home to Chinese emperors for almost 500 years. It has beautiful buildings, golden roofs, and giant courtyards. For a long time, regular people were not allowed to go inside, which is why it’s called the “Forbidden” City. Today, it’s a museum where anyone can visit and learn about China’s history[^5][^7][^8].

Beijing is home to many talented people, including the world-famous composer Tan Dun. He is known for creating music that mixes Chinese and Western styles. Tan Dun won an Academy Award and a Grammy for his music in the movie *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon*. He often uses unusual instruments made from things like water, paper, and stones in his music, making his concerts very exciting to watch and listen to[^3].
