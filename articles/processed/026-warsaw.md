Warsaw is the capital and largest city of Poland. It's an exciting place with lots of history 📚, delicious food 🍲, and amazing people who have changed the world! Let's discover what makes this city so special.

## Where is Warsaw? 📍

Warsaw sits right in the middle of Poland on both sides of the Vistula River 🌊, which is the largest river in the country. It's located in east-central Poland, about 350 kilometers (225 miles) from the Baltic Sea 🌊. The city is built on what geographers call the North European plains. If you look at a map of Europe 🌍, you'll find Warsaw almost in the heart of the continent!

The city is spread across an area of 517 square kilometers (about 200 square miles), which is pretty big - that's about the size of 72,000 soccer ⚽ fields put together!

## How Many People Live There? 👥

Warsaw is home to about 1.86 million people, making it the largest city in Poland and the 6th most populous city in the European Union 🇪🇺. However, recent studies suggest that the actual number might be even higher - possibly over 2 million people!

The city is very diverse, with people from many different countries 🌏. About 250,000 residents are foreigners, including around 160,000 Ukrainians 🇺🇦. People who live in Warsaw are called "Varsovians".

## The Royal Baths Park - A Special Place to Visit 🌳

If you visit Warsaw, you must see Łazienki Park (pronounced wa-ZHEN-kee), also called the Royal Baths Park. It's the largest park in Warsaw, covering 76 hectares in the center of the city.

The park has beautiful palaces 🏰, including a special building that was originally designed as a bathing pavilion. There are also ponds, gardens, and plenty of wildlife. If you're lucky, you might spot red squirrels 🐿️ and peacocks 🦚 that live freely in the park! It's a perfect place for a family picnic or a fun afternoon of exploration. 

## What Language Do People Speak and What Do They Eat? 🗣️🍽️

In Warsaw, people speak Polish (język polski) 🇵🇱, which is the official language of Poland. Polish uses the Latin alphabet like English, but has some special letters with marks on them, like ą, ć, ę, ł, ń, ó, ś, ź, and ż.

Warsaw has many delicious traditional foods! One famous dish is "pyzy" - soft potato dumplings filled with meat that are sometimes served in jars (that's the traditional way). Another popular food is "pierogi" 🥟 - dumplings with different fillings like cheese, potatoes, sauerkraut, or even fruit 🍎. Kids in Poland also enjoy naleśniki (thin pancakes similar to crepes), often filled with sweet cheese and raisins.

## A Famous Musician from Warsaw 🎹

One of the most famous people from Warsaw was Frédéric Chopin 🎶, a brilliant composer and pianist. Though he left Poland when he was young, his heart remained with his homeland. All of Chopin's music was written for the piano, and his compositions are still played by musicians around the world today. His beautiful melodies were often inspired by traditional Polish dances and folk music. If you ever hear piano music that sounds both elegant and emotional, it might be a piece by Chopin!

## Marie Curie - Warsaw's Scientific Superstar 🔬

Did you know that one of the greatest scientists in history was born in Warsaw? Her name was Maria Skłodowska-Curie, though she's often known as Marie Curie. She was the first person ever to win two Nobel Prizes 🏅🏅 - one in Physics and one in Chemistry.

Marie discovered two new elements on the periodic table: polonium (which she named after her home country, Poland) and radium. She also discovered the concept of radioactivity. During World War I, Marie realized that X-rays could help doctors see inside wounded soldiers to treat them better. She created mobile X-ray units called "petites Curies" (little Curies) that saved many lives.

Today, you can visit the Maria Skłodowska-Curie Museum 🏛️ in Warsaw, which is located in a replica of the house where she was born.

## Fun Facts About Warsaw 🎉

Another interesting fact is that Warsaw is the only city in the European Union that has a nature reserve right in the center of the city, called Jeziorko Czernikowskie 🌿.

Warsaw is also known as the "capital of sweets" 🍬 because Poland's most famous candy company, E. Wedel, started there. So if you visit, don't forget to try some delicious Polish chocolate 🍫!
