## Where Exactly is Barcelona? 📍

Barcelona sits on the Mediterranean coast of Spain, in a region called Catalonia. The city has a 4.5-kilometer coastline with seven beautiful beaches 🏖️.

The city enjoys wonderful weather with about 310 sunny days ☀️ every year, making it a perfect place to visit! 🌞

## Amazing Places to See: La Sagrada Familia ⛪

If you visit Barcelona, you absolutely must see La Sagrada Familia! This is a massive, incredible church designed by a famous architect named Antoni Gaudí. Construction on this magnificent building began way back in 1882, and guess what? It's still being built today, more than 140 years later! When completed, La Sagrada Familia will have 18 towers representing the 12 apostles, 4 evangelists, the Virgin Mary, and Jesus. The church looks like something from a fairy tale with its tall, twisting towers and colorful stained glass windows 🌈.

## The People and Their Languages 🗣️

The people of Barcelona speak two main languages. While Spanish is the most widely spoken, many locals also speak Catalan, which is the traditional language of the Catalonia region. About 95% of Barcelona's population understands Catalan. The city was even the capital of Spain for a short time from 1937 to 1939.

## Delicious Catalan Food 🍽️

Barcelona is famous for its tasty food! Catalan cuisine is considered "the richest, most complex and sophisticated in Spain". If you visit Barcelona, you should try some of these yummy dishes:

### Pa amb tomàquet (Bread with Tomato) 🍅

This is one of the simplest but most popular Catalan dishes. It's made by rubbing ripe tomatoes on bread slices 🍞 and adding salt and olive oil. It might sound simple, but it's absolutely delicious!

### Calçots 🌿

These are special sweet onions grown in Catalonia. They're cooked directly over fire 🔥 until the outer layer is burnt but the inside remains tender and tasty. People dip them in a special sauce called romescu.

### Fideuà 🍝

This is similar to seafood paella (a rice dish) but made with noodles instead. It usually includes delicious seafood like monkfish, squid 🦑, and prawns 🍤 cooked in a fish stock.

## Famous Musician: Montserrat Caballé 🎤

Montserrat Caballé was a world-famous opera singer born in Barcelona on April 12, 1933. She was known as one of the best sopranos (a type of singer with a high voice) of the 20th century. She performed in many famous operas all around the world 🌍. You might know her for her duet with Freddie Mercury called "Barcelona," which was used for the 1992 Olympic Games 🎶. She was so talented that people sometimes called her "La Superba" (The Superb One)!

## Famous Scientist: Santiago Ramón y Cajal 🧠

Santiago Ramón y Cajal was a brilliant Spanish scientist who worked in Barcelona from 1887 to 1892. He was a professor of Histology and Pathological Anatomy at the Barcelona Faculty of Medicine 🏥. During his time in Barcelona, he developed his neural theory, which is key to modern neuroscience. This theory helped us understand how our brains work! In 1906, he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 🏆, becoming the first Spaniard to win a scientific Nobel Prize. His detailed drawings of brain cells are still used today for educational purposes.
