## The Amazing Old Town 🌟

One of the most special places to visit in Riga is its Old Town. This area is so historically important that it's protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site! 🏛️ In the Old Town, you can visit the Lutheran cathedral, which is the largest church in all the Baltic states. The streets are often made of cobblestones, and many buildings have stood there for hundreds of years since the city was founded in 1201. Walking through the Old Town is like stepping back in time! ⏳

## What Language Do People Speak and What Do They Eat? 🍽️
