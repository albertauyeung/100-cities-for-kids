Chicago is a super cool city in the state of Illinois, right in the middle of the United States. It sits on the edge of Lake Michigan, which is one of the biggest freshwater lakes in the world. Imagine a place where you can play on beaches 🏖️, see giant skyscrapers 🏢, and visit awesome museums 🎨-all in one spot! Chicago is the third-largest city in the U.S., with over 2.7 million people living there. If you count everyone in the surrounding areas, it’s home to nearly 10 million people.

## **A Special Place to Visit: Millennium Park** 🌳🎨

Millennium Park is like a giant playground in the heart of the city. The most famous thing there is **Cloud Gate**, a shiny silver sculpture shaped like a giant drop of water. You can walk around it and see yourself and the city reflected in its curved surface-it’s like magic! ✨ Nearby, there’s a **Crown Fountain** with giant faces that smile and squirt water in the summer. Kids love running through the water jets to cool off. 💦 The park also has a huge garden called the **Lurie Garden**, filled with flowers and plants that change colors with the seasons. Best of all, Millennium Park is free to visit.

## **Yummy Food: Chicago-Style Pizza** 🍕🤤

Chicago is famous for its **deep-dish pizza**, which is totally different from regular pizza. Instead of a thin crust, it’s baked in a deep pan with a thick, flaky crust. The pizza is loaded with lots of cheese and a chunky tomato sauce on top. Some people even call it a “pizza pie” because it’s so thick! Thin-crust pizza is also popular here, but deep-dish is the star. Did you know that deep-dish pizza was invented in Chicago in the 1940s? It’s a must-try treat when you visit.

## **A Famous Composer: Florence Price** 🎼🎹

Florence Price was a brilliant African American composer and pianist who lived in Chicago. She made history by becoming the *first Black woman* to have her symphony played by a major orchestra-the Chicago Symphony Orchestra! Her **Symphony No. 1 in E minor** was performed in 1933, and the newspaper called it “a work that speaks its own message with restraint and yet with passion.” Florence also wrote music for kids and even created popular songs under a secret name. She proved that anyone can achieve greatness, no matter where they come from.

## **A Famous Scientist: Percy Julian** 🔬🧪

Percy Julian was a genius chemist who worked in Chicago. He figured out how to make medicines from soybeans, like a drug called **physostigmine** that helps people with glaucoma 👁️. He also invented **firefighting foam** using soy proteins, which saved lives by putting out fires faster 🔥. Julian had over 100 patents (like special awards for inventions) and was a hero in the science world. Despite facing racism, he kept working hard and became a role model.

## **Fun Facts About Chicago** 🤓

2. **First Skyscraper**: Chicago built the **Home Insurance Building** in 1885, the world’s first skyscraper. It had 10 stories and was super tall for its time. 🏢
3. **Great Chicago Fire**: A big fire in 1871 burned down much of the city, but Chicago rebuilt stronger than ever. Today, it’s a mix of old and new buildings 🔥🏗️.

## **Cool Things to Do** 🎉
