## Where is Athens Located? 📍

Athens is the capital city of Greece. It's located in a region called Attica, which is a peninsula in the eastern part of Central Greece. A peninsula is a piece of land surrounded by water on three sides. Athens sits on this Attica peninsula, which sticks out into the Aegean Sea. 🌊

The city is surrounded by mountains on three sides, which helped protect it in ancient times. Today, Athens is a busy modern city, but it still has many ancient buildings and monuments that remind us of its long history. 🏔️

## The Amazing Acropolis: A Special Place to Visit 🌄

The most famous place to visit in Athens is the Acropolis. The Acropolis is a tall, rocky hill in the middle of the city with ancient buildings on top. The most important building on the Acropolis is the Parthenon, a beautiful temple built around 2,500 years ago! 🏛️

The Parthenon was built between 447 BC and 432 BC, and it was dedicated to Athena, the goddess who protected the city and gave Athens its name. Even though it's very old and parts of it have been damaged over time, it's still standing today! The people who built it were very clever - they used special tricks to make the building look perfect to our eyes. 👀

The Acropolis is so important that it's been named a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which means it's considered one of the most valuable cultural places in the whole world! 🌍

## How Many People Live in Athens? 👫

Athens is the biggest city in Greece. About 664,046 people live in the central city of Athens, but if you count all the surrounding areas (called the greater urban area), more than 3 million people live there! That's almost one-third of all the people in Greece. 👥

The Attica region, which includes Athens and the surrounding areas, has a population of about 3,784,565 people as of 2024. That's a lot of people living in and around this historic city! 🏙️

## What Language Do People Speak and What Do They Eat? 🍽️

People in Athens speak Greek, which is one of the oldest languages in the world. The official language is called Modern Standard Greek, and it comes directly from Ancient Greek. Many words we use in English today come from Greek words! 🗣️

One famous food from Athens is moussaka. It's a delicious casserole made with layers of eggplant, minced meat, and potatoes, topped with a creamy sauce called béchamel. Greeks usually enjoy moussaka at home with their families rather than ordering it at restaurants. It's a perfect example of Greek comfort food and shows how much Greeks love hearty, wholesome meals. 🍆🥘
