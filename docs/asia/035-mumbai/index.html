  Mumbai, India
  #


City: 孟買 (maang6 maai5)
Country: 🇮🇳 印度 (jan3 dou6)

Mumbai is one of India&rsquo;s most exciting and bustling cities, often called the &ldquo;City of Dreams&rdquo; because so many people come there to follow their dreams! 🌟 This incredible city has a fascinating history, amazing food 🍲, and is home to some very famous people. Let&rsquo;s explore what makes Mumbai so special. 🎭

  Where is Mumbai Located? 🗺️
  #

Mumbai is located on the western coast of India, right next to the beautiful Arabian Sea 🌊. The city sits in the state of Maharashtra and is built on what used to be seven separate islands 🏝️! Can you imagine that? Long ago, clever engineers connected these islands together using land reclamation projects, which means they filled in the water between the islands to create one big city 💡. Mumbai lies on a narrow peninsula called Salsette Island, with the Arabian Sea to the west, Thane Creek to the east, and Vasai Creek to the north.">

<p>Mumbai is one of India&rsquo;s most exciting and bustling cities, often called the &ldquo;City of Dreams&rdquo; because so many people come there to follow their dreams! 🌟 This incredible city has a fascinating history, amazing food 🍲, and is home to some very famous people. Let&rsquo;s explore what makes Mumbai so special. 🎭</p>
<h2 id="where-is-mumbai-located-">
  Where is Mumbai Located? 🗺️
  <a class="anchor" href="#where-is-mumbai-located-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Mumbai is located on the western coast of India, right next to the beautiful Arabian Sea 🌊. The city sits in the state of Maharashtra and is built on what used to be seven separate islands 🏝️! Can you imagine that? Long ago, clever engineers connected these islands together using land reclamation projects, which means they filled in the water between the islands to create one big city 💡. Mumbai lies on a narrow peninsula called Salsette Island, with the Arabian Sea to the west, Thane Creek to the east, and Vasai Creek to the north.</p>
<p>The city coordinates are approximately 19°04′34″N and 72°52′39″E, which means it&rsquo;s in the northern hemisphere and quite far east 🌎. Mumbai is about 875 miles away from India&rsquo;s capital city, New Delhi.</p>

  A Special Place to Visit: The Gateway of India 🏛️
  <a class="anchor" href="#a-special-place-to-visit-the-gateway-of-india-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>One of the most famous and beautiful places to visit in Mumbai is the Gateway of India. This magnificent arch monument looks like a giant stone doorway standing proudly by the sea 🏖️! It was built in 1924 to celebrate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary, who were the King and Queen of England at that time.</p>
<p>The Gateway of India is 26 meters (85 feet) tall and is made of yellow basalt stone. It was designed in a special style called Indo-Saracenic, which mixes Indian, Islamic, and British architectural styles together. The monument has beautiful carved stone work called &ldquo;jaali&rdquo; and four impressive turrets. When you stand there, you can see boats and ships sailing on the Arabian Sea ⛴️, and it&rsquo;s a perfect spot for taking pictures! 📸</p>
<p>What makes this place even more special is that it was the last place where British soldiers left India when the country became independent in 1948. Today, it&rsquo;s one of Mumbai&rsquo;s top tourist attractions and locals love to gather there. 🇮🇳</p>
