  Kyoto, Japan
  #


City: 京都 (ging1 dou1)
Country: 🇯🇵 日本 (jat6 bun2)

Imagine a city that was once home to emperors 👑 and is filled with beautiful temples, amazing food 🍣, and people who created incredible stories and discoveries! That&rsquo;s Kyoto, one of Japan&rsquo;s most special cities. Let&rsquo;s take a journey to learn about this fascinating place that has been amazing people for over 1,000 years.

  Where in the World is Kyoto? 🌏
  #

Kyoto is located on Honshu, Japan&rsquo;s biggest island 🏝️, in a region called Kansai. If you imagine Japan as a long, curved country that looks a bit like a dragon 🐉, Kyoto is right in the middle part of that dragon&rsquo;s body! The city sits in west-central Japan, about 30 miles northeast of the big city of Osaka. If you took Japan&rsquo;s super-fast bullet train 🚄 called the Shinkansen, you could zoom from Tokyo to Kyoto in just 2.5 to 3 hours! The city is built in a valley that gently slopes from north to south, sitting about 180 feet above sea level.">

<p>Imagine a city that was once home to emperors 👑 and is filled with beautiful temples, amazing food 🍣, and people who created incredible stories and discoveries! That&rsquo;s Kyoto, one of Japan&rsquo;s most special cities. Let&rsquo;s take a journey to learn about this fascinating place that has been amazing people for over 1,000 years.</p>
<h2 id="where-in-the-world-is-kyoto-">
  Where in the World is Kyoto? 🌏
  <a class="anchor" href="#where-in-the-world-is-kyoto-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Kyoto is located on Honshu, Japan&rsquo;s biggest island 🏝️, in a region called Kansai. If you imagine Japan as a long, curved country that looks a bit like a dragon 🐉, Kyoto is right in the middle part of that dragon&rsquo;s body! The city sits in west-central Japan, about 30 miles northeast of the big city of Osaka. If you took Japan&rsquo;s super-fast bullet train 🚄 called the Shinkansen, you could zoom from Tokyo to Kyoto in just 2.5 to 3 hours! The city is built in a valley that gently slopes from north to south, sitting about 180 feet above sea level.</p>
<h2 id="a-magical-temple-with-an-amazing-view-">
  A Magical Temple with an Amazing View 🏯👀
  <a class="anchor" href="#a-magical-temple-with-an-amazing-view-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>One of Kyoto&rsquo;s most incredible places to visit is called Kiyomizu-dera, which means &ldquo;Pure Water Temple&rdquo; 💧. This Buddhist temple was built way back in 778 - that&rsquo;s over 1,200 years ago! What makes this temple super special is that it has a huge wooden stage that sticks out from the main building, giving visitors amazing views of the city below. Here&rsquo;s the coolest part: the entire temple was built without using a single nail 🔨! The builders were so skilled that they fit all the wooden pieces together perfectly, like a giant 3D puzzle 🧩. The temple gets its name from a beautiful waterfall that flows nearby, bringing pure, clean water down from the surrounding hills.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-people-live-in-kyoto-">
  How Many People Live in Kyoto? 👥
  <a class="anchor" href="#how-many-people-live-in-kyoto-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Kyoto is home to 1,463,723 people, making it the ninth-most populous city in Japan. To help you imagine how big that is, it&rsquo;s like having about 15 cities the size of a medium-sized American city all living together! The people of Kyoto include 692,279 males and 771,444 females 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦. More than half of all the people who live in Kyoto Prefecture (the larger area around the city) actually live right in Kyoto city itself.</p>
<h2 id="special-language-and-delicious-food-">
  Special Language and Delicious Food 🍜🎋
  <a class="anchor" href="#special-language-and-delicious-food-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The people of Kyoto speak Japanese, but they have their own special way of speaking called &ldquo;Kyo-Kotoba&rdquo; or &ldquo;Kyoto-ben&rdquo; 🗣️. This dialect sounds softer and more polite than regular Japanese, and it reflects the city&rsquo;s elegant history as the home of emperors and nobles. The way people speak in Kyoto developed during the Heian period (794-1185) when Kyoto was Japan&rsquo;s capital, and it became the language of the royal court.</p>
<p>Kyoto is also famous for its incredible food! The most special type of cooking here is called &ldquo;kaiseki,&rdquo; which is like edible art 🎨. Kaiseki is a multi-course meal where each dish is carefully crafted to look beautiful and taste amazing. The chefs choose ingredients based on what season it is - so in spring you might eat dishes with cherry blossoms 🌸, and in autumn you might have foods that match the colorful fall leaves 🍂. Each plate looks like a tiny work of art that tells a story about nature and the changing seasons.</p>

<p>Kyoto is the birthplace of Keiko Fujiie, a famous composer born in 1963 🎻. Keiko creates beautiful music that people love to listen to both in Japan and around the world. She&rsquo;s especially good at writing music for guitars 🎸, and many of her pieces are played by her husband, who is a very skilled guitarist named Kazuhito Yamashita. Keiko has won important prizes 🏆 for her music, including the Otaka Prize twice! She even wrote special pieces for big celebrations, like music for Kyoto University&rsquo;s 100th anniversary.

<p>One of the world&rsquo;s most important scientists, Tasuku Honjo, was born in Kyoto in 1942. Dr. Honjo studied medicine at Kyoto University and made an incredible discovery that helps doctors fight cancer 🎗️. In 1992, he found a special protein called PD-1 that acts like a brake on our body&rsquo;s immune system. By learning how to turn off this brake, doctors can help our bodies fight cancer cells much better. His amazing discovery was so important that he won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine 🏅 in 2018!

<p>Over 1,000 years ago, a woman named Murasaki Shikibu lived in Kyoto (which was then called Heian-kyo). She wrote what many people think is the world&rsquo;s first novel, called &ldquo;The Tale of Genji&rdquo; 📜. This amazing story is still read and loved by people today, even though it was written around the year 1000! Murasaki was very smart and learned to read and write Chinese, which was unusual for women in her time. Her father once said he wished she had been born a boy because she was so clever. She worked as a lady-in-waiting for the empress and wrote her famous story during that time. What&rsquo;s incredible is that her book is still considered one of the greatest stories ever written, more than 1,000 years later!</p>

  Amazing Fun Facts About Kyoto 🤩

<p>Here are some super cool things about Kyoto that might surprise you! First, Kyoto was the capital of Japan for more than 1,000 years, from 794 to 1868 🗓️. That means emperors lived and ruled from Kyoto for over ten centuries - much longer than the United States has even existed as a country!</p>
<p>Second, there&rsquo;s a funny expression in Japanese that comes from Kiyomizu-dera temple. When Japanese people want to say someone should &ldquo;take the plunge&rdquo; or do something brave 🎢, they say &ldquo;jump off the stage at Kiyomizu&rdquo;. This saying comes from a real tradition during the Edo period (1603-1868) when people actually jumped from the temple&rsquo;s wooden stage, which is 43 feet high! Records show that 234 people jumped during this time period, and amazingly, 85.4% of them survived the fall. People believed that if they survived the jump, their wish would come true. Don&rsquo;t worry though - this practice was stopped in 1872, so no one is allowed to jump anymore!</p>
<p>Finally, Kyoto is incredibly lucky because it wasn&rsquo;t damaged during World War II, which means all of its beautiful old temples, palaces, and traditional buildings are still there for us to see today. This is why Kyoto has so many UNESCO World Heritage Sites and why it&rsquo;s considered the cultural heart of Japan ❤️.</p>
