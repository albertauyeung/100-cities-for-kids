In fact, it\u0026rsquo;s the second highest capital city in the European Union (after Madrid, Spain) and the third highest in all of Europe.\nUnlike many capital cities that are built along big rivers, Sofia doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a major river running through it. Instead, it has several smaller rivers that cross through the city. 🌊 The city is surrounded by beautiful mountains that you can see from almost anywhere in town. 🏞️\nAmazing Places to See 🏰 # The most incredible building in Sofia is the Saint Alexander Nevsky Cathedral. ⛪ This massive church is one of Sofia\u0026rsquo;s most important landmarks and a place that almost all tourists want to visit.

This enormous square is surrounded by incredible buildings that look like they came straight out of a fairy tale. The most famous building on Red Square is Saint Basil\u0026rsquo;s Cathedral, which was built way back in the 1550s by a ruler named Ivan the Terrible. This cathedral is absolutely amazing to look at because it has nine separate chapels, each topped with its own colorful dome that\u0026rsquo;s shaped differently from all the others.

In 2025, about 12.7 million people live within the city limits, which makes it the most populous city that is entirely in Europe.

If you include all the surrounding areas where people live and work, the total number grows to over 21.5 million people.

Born on January 6, 1872, Scriabin created music that was unlike anything anyone had heard before. He was initially inspired by the famous composer Frédéric Chopin, but later developed his own unique style that was much more adventurous and experimental. What made Scriabin really special was that he believed music could be connected to colors - he thought different musical notes should match different colors, and he even wanted to project colored lights during his concerts. 🎶🌈 He composed beautiful piano pieces and orchestral works, including something called the \u0026ldquo;Poem of Ecstasy\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Prometheus,\u0026rdquo; which were meant to represent amazing spiritual journeys. Sadly, Scriabin died young at age 43 in 1915, but his music continues to amaze people around the world.\nAndrei Sakharov: The Brilliant Scientist 🧪🔬 # Another remarkable person from Moscow was Andrei Sakharov, a brilliant physicist who was born in the city on May 21, 1921. Sakharov became one of the world\u0026rsquo;s most important scientists, working on nuclear physics and helping to develop some of the most powerful scientific discoveries of the 20th century. But what made Sakharov truly special was that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t just a great scientist - he was also a champion for human rights and peace. 🕊️✌️ He believed that science should be used to help humanity, not harm it, and he spent much of his life working to make the world a better place. In 1975, he won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to promote human rights and reduce the dangers of nuclear weapons. Even though the Soviet government sometimes disagreed with his ideas, Sakharov never stopped fighting for what he believed was right.\nBoris Pasternak: The Beloved Writer ✍️📚 # Moscow was also home to Boris Pasternak, one of Russia\u0026rsquo;s greatest writers and poets.

Pasternak became famous for writing beautiful poetry, but his most famous work was a novel called \u0026ldquo;Doctor Zhivago,\u0026rdquo; which tells the story of a doctor during the Russian Revolution and World War I. 📖 This book became incredibly popular around the world and was even made into a famous movie. 📽️ In 1958, Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, which is one of the highest honors a writer can receive. Unfortunately, the Soviet government at the time didn\u0026rsquo;t approve of his book, so he wasn\u0026rsquo;t allowed to accept the prize in person. However, his son was finally able to accept the award on his father\u0026rsquo;s behalf many years later in 1989.\nAmazing Fun Facts About Moscow 🌟🤔 # Moscow is full of surprising and wonderful facts that make it truly unique! First, Moscow is actually the northernmost and coldest megacity in the entire world, which means it gets much colder than any other city with more than 10 million people. During winter, temperatures can drop to about -10°C (14°F), and the city often gets covered in beautiful white snow. ❄️☃️ Another fascinating fact is that Moscow is sometimes called the \u0026ldquo;City of Bridges\u0026rdquo; because there are about 50 bridges spanning the Moskva River and its canals within the city limits. 🌉 The city is also incredibly green - over 40 percent of Moscow is covered by parks, forests, and other green spaces, making it one of the greenest major cities in Europe. 🌳 Perhaps most amazing of all is the Moscow Metro, the city\u0026rsquo;s subway system, which is famous for having some of the most beautiful underground stations in the world. 🚇 These stations are decorated with gorgeous artwork, sculptures, and chandeliers, making them look more like underground palaces than train stations. Many people say riding the Moscow Metro is like visiting an underground art gallery!\nConclusion 🌍✨ # Moscow is truly one of the world\u0026rsquo;s most remarkable cities, combining incredible history, amazing architecture, delicious food, and the legacy of brilliant people who have made important contributions to music, science, and literature.

Kyoto","section":"Asia","content":" Kyoto, Japan # City: 京都 (ging1 dou1) Country: 🇯🇵 日本 (jat6 bun2) Imagine a city that was once home to emperors 👑 and is filled with beautiful temples, amazing food 🍣, and people who created incredible stories and discoveries! That\u0026rsquo;s Kyoto, one of Japan\u0026rsquo;s most special cities. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a journey to learn about this fascinating place that has been amazing people for over 1,000 years.\nWhere in the World is Kyoto? 🌏 # Kyoto is located on Honshu, Japan\u0026rsquo;s biggest island 🏝️, in a region called Kansai. If you imagine Japan as a long, curved country that looks a bit like a dragon 🐉, Kyoto is right in the middle part of that dragon\u0026rsquo;s body! The city sits in west-central Japan, about 30 miles northeast of the big city of Osaka. If you took Japan\u0026rsquo;s super-fast bullet train 🚄 called the Shinkansen, you could zoom from Tokyo to Kyoto in just 2.5 to 3 hours! The city is built in a valley that gently slopes from north to south, sitting about 180 feet above sea level.\nA Magical Temple with an Amazing View 🏯👀 # One of Kyoto\u0026rsquo;s most incredible places to visit is called Kiyomizu-dera, which means \u0026ldquo;Pure Water Temple\u0026rdquo; 💧. This Buddhist temple was built way back in 778 - that\u0026rsquo;s over 1,200 years ago! What makes this temple super special is that it has a huge wooden stage that sticks out from the main building, giving visitors amazing views of the city below. Here\u0026rsquo;s the coolest part: the entire temple was built without using a single nail 🔨! The builders were so skilled that they fit all the wooden pieces together perfectly, like a giant 3D puzzle 🧩. The temple gets its name from a beautiful waterfall that flows nearby, bringing pure, clean water down from the surrounding hills.\nHow Many People Live in Kyoto? 👥 # Kyoto is home to 1,463,723 people, making it the ninth-most populous city in Japan. To help you imagine how big that is, it\u0026rsquo;s like having about 15 cities the size of a medium-sized American city all living together! The people of Kyoto include 692,279 males and 771,444 females 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦. More than half of all the people who live in Kyoto Prefecture (the larger area around the city) actually live right in Kyoto city itself.\nSpecial Language and Delicious Food 🍜🎋 # The people of Kyoto speak Japanese, but they have their own special way of speaking called \u0026ldquo;Kyo-Kotoba\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Kyoto-ben\u0026rdquo; 🗣️. This dialect sounds softer and more polite than regular Japanese, and it reflects the city\u0026rsquo;s elegant history as the home of emperors and nobles. The way people speak in Kyoto developed during the Heian period (794-1185) when Kyoto was Japan\u0026rsquo;s capital, and it became the language of the royal court.\nKyoto is also famous for its incredible food! The most special type of cooking here is called \u0026ldquo;kaiseki,\u0026rdquo; which is like edible art 🎨. Kaiseki is a multi-course meal where each dish is carefully crafted to look beautiful and taste amazing. The chefs choose ingredients based on what season it is - so in spring you might eat dishes with cherry blossoms 🌸, and in autumn you might have foods that match the colorful fall leaves 🍂. Each plate looks like a tiny work of art that tells a story about nature and the changing seasons.\nA Musical Composer Who Creates Beautiful Sounds 🎶 # Kyoto is the birthplace of Keiko Fujiie, a famous composer born in 1963 🎻. Keiko creates beautiful music that people love to listen to both in Japan and around the world. She\u0026rsquo;s especially good at writing music for guitars 🎸, and many of her pieces are played by her husband, who is a very skilled guitarist named Kazuhito Yamashita. Keiko has won important prizes 🏆 for her music, including the Otaka Prize twice! She even wrote special pieces for big celebrations, like music for Kyoto University\u0026rsquo;s 100th anniversary.

Dr. Honjo studied medicine at Kyoto University and made an incredible discovery that helps doctors fight cancer 🎗️. In 1992, he found a special protein called PD-1 that acts like a brake on our body\u0026rsquo;s immune system. By learning how to turn off this brake, doctors can help our bodies fight cancer cells much better. His amazing discovery was so important that he won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine 🏅 in 2018! This means he\u0026rsquo;s recognized as one of the smartest people in the world for helping save lives through his scientific work.\nA Story Writer from Long, Long Ago 📚✒️ # Over 1,000 years ago, a woman named Murasaki Shikibu lived in Kyoto (which was then called Heian-kyo). She wrote what many people think is the world\u0026rsquo;s first novel, called \u0026ldquo;The Tale of Genji\u0026rdquo; 📜. This amazing story is still read and loved by people today, even though it was written around the year 1000! Murasaki was very smart and learned to read and write Chinese, which was unusual for women in her time. Her father once said he wished she had been born a boy because she was so clever. She worked as a lady-in-waiting for the empress and wrote her famous story during that time. What\u0026rsquo;s incredible is that her book is still considered one of the greatest stories ever written, more than 1,000 years later!\nAmazing Fun Facts About Kyoto 🤩 # Here are some super cool things about Kyoto that might surprise you! First, Kyoto was the capital of Japan for more than 1,000 years, from 794 to 1868 🗓️. That means emperors lived and ruled from Kyoto for over ten centuries - much longer than the United States has even existed as a country!\nSecond, there\u0026rsquo;s a funny expression in Japanese that comes from Kiyomizu-dera temple. When Japanese people want to say someone should \u0026ldquo;take the plunge\u0026rdquo; or do something brave 🎢, they say \u0026ldquo;jump off the stage at Kiyomizu\u0026rdquo;. This saying comes from a real tradition during the Edo period (1603-1868) when people actually jumped from the temple\u0026rsquo;s wooden stage, which is 43 feet high! Records show that 234 people jumped during this time period, and amazingly, 85.4% of them survived the fall. People believed that if they survived the jump, their wish would come true. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry though - this practice was stopped in 1872, so no one is allowed to jump anymore!\nFinally, Kyoto is incredibly lucky because it wasn\u0026rsquo;t damaged during World War II, which means all of its beautiful old temples, palaces, and traditional buildings are still there for us to see today. This is why Kyoto has so many UNESCO World Heritage Sites and why it\u0026rsquo;s considered the cultural heart of Japan ❤️.\nConclusion 🎆 # Kyoto is truly a magical city where the past and present come together in the most beautiful way. From its ancient temples built without nails to its Nobel Prize-winning scientists, from its thousand-year-old stories to its modern composers, Kyoto continues to be a place where amazing things happen. With its special dialect, artistic food, and incredible history as Japan\u0026rsquo;s capital for over 1,000 years, Kyoto shows us how a city can preserve its traditions while still being home to people who make new discoveries and create beautiful art. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re interested in science, music, literature, or just beautiful places to visit, Kyoto has something amazing to offer everyone! 😍\n"},{"id":41,"href":"/100-cities-for-kids/asia/042-kualalumpur/","title":"042.

Even though it is a large city, many Aucklanders enjoy easy access to beaches 🏖️, parks 🌳, and volcano cones, giving the city a unique blend of urban life and natural beauty.\nWhat Languages and Foods Do You Find in Auckland? 🍜 # Languages 🗣️ # In Auckland, you will hear many languages spoken in everyday life, but English is by far the most common language for school, shops, and television. As a country influenced by both its native Māori heritage and international connections, New Zealand also recognises the Māori language (te reo Māori) as an official language, and you might spot Māori words in place names, signs, and songs. In some neighbourhoods, you may hear Pacific Island languages such as Samoan and Tongan or Asian languages like Mandarin and Hindi, reflecting the backgrounds of families who have made Auckland their home. This interesting mix makes Auckland a great place to learn a few words in different languages and to appreciate how people from many parts of the world live side by side.\nFoods 🍴 # Auckland’s kitchens and restaurants serve dishes from nearly every corner of the world, but some flavours are special to New Zealand. One traditional Māori meal is the hangi, where meats and vegetables are cooked in an earth oven underground, creating a smoky and tender feast. Another favourite local treat is fish and chips 🍟, but instead of using cod or haddock as in other countries, New Zealanders often fry fresh hoki or blue cod in a crispy batter and serve it with chips on the beach for a fun seaside snack. When you explore Auckland’s markets and bakeries, you might also discover meat pies filled with savory fillings like steak and cheese, or sweet treats such as pavlova— a fluffy meringue topped with whipped cream and fresh fruit 🍓. The mix of Māori flavours, British classics, and international cuisine makes eating in Auckland an exciting adventure for your taste buds.\nFamous Composer from Auckland: Gareth Farr 🎼 # Auckland has given the world many musical talents, including the classical composer and percussionist Gareth Farr, who was born in Wellington but grew up and studied music at the University of Auckland, where he began to explore various styles and instruments. Farr’s music often blends Western orchestral sounds with the rhythms and textures of Indonesian gamelan and percussion ensembles, creating lively and colourful compositions enjoyed by audiences in New Zealand and around the world. One of his famous works, \u0026ldquo;From the Depths Sound the Great Sea Gongs,\u0026rdquo; was commissioned to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and showcases his skill at combining traditional percussion with orchestral forces.

Born and educated in Auckland, O’Shea earned his PhD studying octopuses before working for New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, where he began deep-sea expeditions to find and study colossal squids in their natural habitat. His pioneering work helped scientists learn more about squid biology, behaviour, and their gigantic size, sometimes over 10 metres long, making them legendary figures of the deep ocean 🌊. Beyond his squid research, O’Shea has published widely on marine ecology and animal conservation, inspiring many young people to look to the seas for scientific adventure.\nFamous Author from Auckland: Ruth Park 📚 # Although she moved to Australia later in life, Auckland-born Ruth Park began her writing journey in New Zealand and went on to become one of the country’s best-loved authors.
