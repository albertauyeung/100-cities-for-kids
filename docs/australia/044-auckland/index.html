City: 奧克蘭 (ou3 hak1 laan4)
Country: 🇳🇿 紐西蘭 (nau2 sai1 laan4)

Nestled between two great harbours on the North Island of New Zealand, Auckland is a bustling city known for its beautiful landscapes, diverse cultures, and exciting attractions. Often called the &ldquo;City of Sails&rdquo; ⛵, Auckland lies on an isthmus flanked by the Pacific Ocean 🌊 and the Tasman Sea, making it one of the few cities globally to enjoy coastlines on two separate major bodies of water. Home to over 1.7 million people, Auckland is not only the largest city in New Zealand but also a vibrant hub where languages, foods, and traditions from around the world come together. Visitors can marvel at soaring volcano cones 🌋, wander through lush parks, and admire the striking Sky Tower 🗼 that reaches high above the city skyline. Beyond its natural wonders and iconic landmarks, Auckland has been the birthplace of remarkable talents, including a famous classical composer, a pioneering marine scientist, and an acclaimed author whose stories have inspired readers for decades. This guide introduces young explorers to Auckland’s location, sights, people, and fun facts, providing a friendly journey through one of the most exciting cities in the South Pacific.">

<p>Nestled between two great harbours on the North Island of New Zealand, Auckland is a bustling city known for its beautiful landscapes, diverse cultures, and exciting attractions. Often called the &ldquo;City of Sails&rdquo; ⛵, Auckland lies on an isthmus flanked by the Pacific Ocean 🌊 and the Tasman Sea, making it one of the few cities globally to enjoy coastlines on two separate major bodies of water. Home to over 1.7 million people, Auckland is not only the largest city in New Zealand but also a vibrant hub where languages, foods, and traditions from around the world come together. Visitors can marvel at soaring volcano cones 🌋, wander through lush parks, and admire the striking Sky Tower 🗼 that reaches high above the city skyline. Beyond its natural wonders and iconic landmarks, Auckland has been the birthplace of remarkable talents, including a famous classical composer, a pioneering marine scientist, and an acclaimed author whose stories have inspired readers for decades. This guide introduces young explorers to Auckland’s location, sights, people, and fun facts, providing a friendly journey through one of the most exciting cities in the South Pacific.</p>
<h2 id="where-is-auckland-">
  Where Is Auckland? 📍
  <a class="anchor" href="#where-is-auckland-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Auckland sits in the northern part of New Zealand&rsquo;s North Island, occupying a narrow strip of land between the Waitematā Harbour to the east and the Manukau Harbour to the west. The city spreads out over rolling hills and across dormant volcanic cones, many of which offer wonderful viewpoints of the surrounding waters and islands. Its convenient coastal position has shaped Auckland’s history as a major port and trading centre since its early days, when Māori communities first settled there around the year 1350. Today, roads, trains 🚆, and ferries connect different parts of the city and its neighbouring suburbs, while an international airport ✈️ links Auckland to the rest of the world, making it an important gateway to New Zealand’s unique landscapes.</p>
<h2 id="a-special-sightseeing-spot-sky-tower-">
  A Special Sightseeing Spot: Sky Tower 🎡
  <a class="anchor" href="#a-special-sightseeing-spot-sky-tower-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Standing at 328 metres tall, the <strong>Sky Tower</strong> is the tallest freestanding structure in the Southern Hemisphere and an unmistakable feature of Auckland’s skyline. From its glass-floored observation decks, visitors can gaze out across the city streets, sparkling harbours, and distant islands, spotting landmarks such as Rangitoto Island and the Harbour Bridge 🌁 in the distance. Thrill-seekers can venture onto the SkyWalk ledge that circles the tower, secured by safety harnesses, or experience the adrenaline rush of a SkyJump—a controlled base jump that sends jumpers hurtling towards the ground before being gently slowed by wires. At the top, the revolving restaurant offers a chance to savour tasty meals 🥗 while slowly rotating, ensuring diners see every angle of the city below. Whether you come for the views, the adventure, or a meal above the clouds, the Sky Tower delivers a truly unforgettable Auckland experience.</p>

  Who Lives in Auckland? (Population) 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦
  <a class="anchor" href="#who-lives-in-auckland-population-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Auckland is New Zealand’s largest and fastest-growing city, with an estimated urban population of around 1.7 million people as of 2025, representing about one-third of the nation’s residents. The city’s growth has been fueled by both natural increase and waves of immigration, making it one of the most multicultural urban areas in the world. People of European, Māori, Pacific Island, and Asian heritage all contribute to Auckland’s colourful tapestry of languages, traditions, and community events. This diversity is celebrated in festivals, markets, and neighbourhoods across the city, where different cultures share their art 🎨, music 🎶, and cuisines. Even though it is a large city, many Aucklanders enjoy easy access to beaches 🏖️, parks 🌳, and volcano cones, giving the city a unique blend of urban life and natural beauty.</p>

  Languages 🗣️

<p>In Auckland, you will hear many languages spoken in everyday life, but English is by far the most common language for school, shops, and television. As a country influenced by both its native Māori heritage and international connections, New Zealand also recognises the Māori language (te reo Māori) as an official language, and you might spot Māori words in place names, signs, and songs. In some neighbourhoods, you may hear Pacific Island languages such as Samoan and Tongan or Asian languages like Mandarin and Hindi, reflecting the backgrounds of families who have made Auckland their home. This interesting mix makes Auckland a great place to learn a few words in different languages and to appreciate how people from many parts of the world live side by side.</p>

  Foods 🍴

<p>Auckland’s kitchens and restaurants serve dishes from nearly every corner of the world, but some flavours are special to New Zealand. One traditional Māori meal is the <em>hangi</em>, where meats and vegetables are cooked in an earth oven underground, creating a smoky and tender feast. Another favourite local treat is fish and chips 🍟, but instead of using cod or haddock as in other countries, New Zealanders often fry fresh hoki or blue cod in a crispy batter and serve it with chips on the beach for a fun seaside snack. When you explore Auckland’s markets and bakeries, you might also discover meat pies filled with savory fillings like steak and cheese, or sweet treats such as pavlova— a fluffy meringue topped with whipped cream and fresh fruit 🍓. The mix of Māori flavours, British classics, and international cuisine makes eating in Auckland an exciting adventure for your taste buds.</p>

<p>Auckland is built on a field of over 50 volcanoes 🌋, though all of them are currently dormant and safe to explore, with many turned into parks that offer great city views from their summits.
