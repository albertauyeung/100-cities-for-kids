Sofia","section":"Europe","content":" Sofia, Bulgaria # City: 索非亞 (sok3 fei1 aa3) Country: 🇧🇬 保加利亚 (bou2 gaa1 lei6 aa3) Sofia is the exciting capital city of Bulgaria, with a history going back thousands of years! 🏛️ Today, it\u0026rsquo;s a modern city where old buildings and new ones stand side by side. 🏘️ If you\u0026rsquo;re learning about world geography, 🌍 Sofia is definitely a place worth knowing about. It\u0026rsquo;s filled with beautiful churches, ⛪ delicious foods 🍲, and has been home to many important people who have changed the world with their ideas and creations. 💡\nWhere is Sofia? 📍 # Sofia sits in a special valley called the Sofia Valley, at the foot of a mountain called Vitosha. 🏔️ It\u0026rsquo;s located in the western part of Bulgaria, near the center of a region called the Balkans. What makes Sofia\u0026rsquo;s location really neat is that it sits almost exactly in the middle between two seas - the Black Sea ⚫ and the Adriatic Sea. 🌊 It\u0026rsquo;s also one of the highest capital cities in Europe! In fact, it\u0026rsquo;s the second highest capital city in the European Union (after Madrid, Spain) and the third highest in all of Europe.\nUnlike many capital cities that are built along big rivers, Sofia doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a major river running through it. Instead, it has several smaller rivers that cross through the city. 🌊 The city is surrounded by beautiful mountains that you can see from almost anywhere in town. 🏞️\nAmazing Places to See 🏰 # The most incredible building in Sofia is the Saint Alexander Nevsky Cathedral. ⛪ This massive church is one of Sofia\u0026rsquo;s most important landmarks and a place that almost all tourists want to visit. It was built between 1904 and 1912 in a style called Neo-Byzantine, which means it looks a bit like ancient churches from long ago.\nThe cathedral is HUGE! It can hold 5,000 people inside at once and is one of the 50 largest Christian church buildings in the entire world. 🌍 It\u0026rsquo;s also the largest cathedral in an area called the Balkans. When you step inside, you can look up at its beautiful domes that rise high above your head. 🌟 The main dome reaches 46.3 meters high (that\u0026rsquo;s about as tall as a 15-story building)!\nThe People of Sofia 👥 # About 1,286,000 people live in Sofia as of 2025. That\u0026rsquo;s a lot of people! To help you imagine how many that is, think about filling about 17,000 school buses with people 🚌 - that\u0026rsquo;s roughly how many people live in Sofia! The city is home to about 17.9% of Bulgaria\u0026rsquo;s total population, which means about 1 out of every 6 Bulgarians lives in or around Sofia.\nIn recent years, Sofia\u0026rsquo;s population has been pretty stable, with just a tiny decrease of about 0.16% from 2024 to 2025. 📉 This means that almost the same number of people live there now as did last year.\nBulgarian Language and Yummy Foods 🍽️ # People in Sofia speak Bulgarian, which uses a special alphabet called Cyrillic. 🗣️ Some simple Bulgarian phrases you might want to learn are \u0026ldquo;Здрасти\u0026rdquo; (pronounced \u0026ldquo;zdrasti\u0026rdquo;), which means \u0026ldquo;Hello,\u0026rdquo; 👋 and \u0026ldquo;благодаря\u0026rdquo; (pronounced \u0026ldquo;blagodarya\u0026rdquo;), which means \u0026ldquo;Thank you\u0026rdquo;. 🙏\nHere\u0026rsquo;s something funny: 🤭 Bulgarians shake their heads differently than people in most other countries! When they mean \u0026ldquo;yes,\u0026rdquo; they shake their heads from side to side (which is how many people indicate \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;). And when they mean \u0026ldquo;no,\u0026rdquo; they nod up and down (which is how many people usually say \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo;). This could get confusing if you visit! 🤔\nBulgarian food is delicious! 😋 One popular dish is Shopska Salad, which has tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, and a special Bulgarian white cheese called sirene. 🥗 The salad has the same colors as the Bulgarian flag - white, green, and red! 🇧🇬 Another tasty treat is Banitsa, a cheesy pastry that many Bulgarians eat for breakfast. 🥐 They also love grilled meats called Kebapche, which are like small sausages made from beef and pork with special spices. 🍖\nFamous People from Sofia 🎓 # A Musical Master 🎼 # Triphon Silyanovski was an important composer and pianist who was born right here in Sofia on December 16, 1923. 🎹 He was very talented and studied both music and law! 🏛️ He was a wonderful piano player and won the first Bulgarian Singers\u0026rsquo; and Instrumentalists\u0026rsquo; Competition.
