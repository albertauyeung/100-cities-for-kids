<p>Do you want to visit a city filled with movie stars, sunny beaches, and towering mountains? Let&rsquo;s take a trip to Los Angeles, one of the most exciting cities in the United States! Los Angeles, often called L.A. for short, is a place where dreams come true and adventures await around every corner. 🎬☀️✨</p>
<h2 id="where-in-the-world-is-los-angeles-">
  Where in the World is Los Angeles? 🌎
  <a class="anchor" href="#where-in-the-world-is-los-angeles-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Los Angeles sits in southern California, right next to the beautiful Pacific Ocean. 🌊 It&rsquo;s the second-largest city in the United States, after New York City. The city is mainly built in a desert basin, surrounded by magnificent mountains including the San Gabriel Mountains and divided by the Santa Monica Mountains. ⛰️</p>
<p>Los Angeles is huge! It covers about 502.7 square miles - that&rsquo;s almost 470 square miles of land and 34 square miles of water. If you wanted to travel from the northernmost part of L.A. to the southernmost part, you&rsquo;d need to go 44 miles (71 kilometers), and from east to west, it&rsquo;s 29 miles (47 kilometers). Los Angeles County (the larger area that includes the city) has 75 miles of beautiful coastline where you can swim, surf, and build sandcastles. 🏄‍♀️🏖️</p>
<h2 id="the-famous-hollywood-sign-">
  The Famous Hollywood Sign 🎥🎬
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-famous-hollywood-sign-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>One of the most special places to visit in Los Angeles is the Hollywood Sign. This giant sign sits on Mount Lee in the Santa Monica Mountains and is one of the most famous landmarks in the whole world! 🌟</p>
<p>The sign is enormous - each letter is 45 feet tall (about as high as a 4-story building), and the whole sign stretches 450 feet long. That&rsquo;s longer than a football field! Originally built in 1923, it actually said &ldquo;HOLLYWOODLAND&rdquo; and was just an advertisement for new houses being built in the area. In 1949, they removed the &ldquo;LAND&rdquo; part, and in 1978, they rebuilt the entire sign to make it stronger. 🏗️</p>
<p>Today, millions of people visit Los Angeles just to take pictures with this iconic sign in the background. You can see it from many places in the city, but some of the best views are from Griffith Observatory or the Hollywood &amp; Highland shopping center. 📸👀</p>
<h2 id="the-people-of-los-angeles-">
  The People of Los Angeles 👥
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-people-of-los-angeles-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Los Angeles is home to lots and lots of people! About 3.8 million people live within the city limits as of 2023. That makes it the second most populous city in the United States. But the greater Los Angeles area (which includes nearby cities) is even bigger, with about 12.9 million people calling it home. That&rsquo;s more people than in many entire countries! 🌎</p>
<h2 id="languages-and-food-">
  Languages and Food 🍔🥗
  <a class="anchor" href="#languages-and-food-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>One amazing thing about Los Angeles is how many different languages you can hear while walking down the street. While most people speak English, over half of the city&rsquo;s population also speaks Spanish. You can also hear people speaking Mandarin Chinese, Korean, Tagalog (from the Philippines), Armenian, and Persian (also called Farsi). 🗣️🗨️</p>
<p>When it comes to food, Los Angeles has lots of delicious things to try! One famous food from L.A. is the Cobb Salad, which was invented at the Hollywood Brown Derby restaurant. Los Angeles is also home to the very first In-N-Out Burger, which opened in 1948. This famous burger restaurant started as a tiny stand (only 100 square feet!) where people could order food without leaving their cars - one of the first drive-thru restaurants in California. 🚗🍟</p>
