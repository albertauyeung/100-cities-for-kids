  Where Is Toronto? 📍
  <a class="anchor" href="#where-is-toronto-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Toronto is the capital city of Ontario, which is a province in Canada. It sits on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario 🌊, one of the five Great Lakes of North America. If you look at a map of Canada, you&rsquo;ll find Toronto in the southeastern part of the country. It&rsquo;s actually not too far from the United States border! 🇺🇸</p>
<p>Toronto is the largest city in Canada and covers an area of about 630 square kilometers (243 square miles). That&rsquo;s about the size of 118,000 soccer fields put together! ⚽️</p>
<h2 id="the-amazing-cn-tower-">
  The Amazing CN Tower 🗼
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-amazing-cn-tower-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If you visit Toronto, you absolutely must see the CN Tower! This incredible tower stands 553.3 meters (1,815.3 feet) tall, which is about as high as 181 ten-story buildings stacked on top of each other. It was the tallest free-standing structure in the whole world from 1975 until 2007, when it was finally surpassed by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. 🏗️🌆</p>
<p>The CN Tower has some super fun features that kids love. 🎢 There&rsquo;s a glass floor where you can stand and look straight down (if you&rsquo;re brave enough!), observation decks with amazing views of the entire city, and even a revolving restaurant where the floor slowly turns so you can see everything while you eat. 🍽️ The tower took three years to build and was completed in 1976.</p>
<h2 id="the-people-of-toronto-">
  The People of Toronto 👫🌎
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-people-of-toronto-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Toronto is a huge city with lots of people. According to the latest information, about 2.8 million people live in the city itself. But if you count all the surrounding areas (called the Greater Toronto Area), there are more than 6.5 million people living there! That&rsquo;s about the same as the entire population of Switzerland! 🇨🇭</p>
<p>Toronto keeps growing bigger every year. 📈 Between 2022 and 2023, more than 268,000 new people came to live in the Toronto area. That&rsquo;s like adding a whole new city in just one year! 🏢🏠</p>
<h2 id="languages-and-food-">
  Languages and Food 🍽️🌍
  <a class="anchor" href="#languages-and-food-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>One of the coolest things about Toronto is how many different languages you can hear while walking down the street. People in Toronto speak approximately 200 different languages! 🗣️ Besides English, you might hear people speaking Cantonese, Italian, Spanish, Tagalog, Tamil, Mandarin, and Portuguese, which all have more than 50,000 speakers in the city.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re hungry in Toronto, you should definitely try the city&rsquo;s signature dish: peameal bacon on a roll. 🥓🥪 This special type of bacon was invented in Toronto when the city was nicknamed &ldquo;Hogtown&rdquo; because of all the pork processing that happened there. Peameal bacon is made from cured pork loin rolled in yellow cornmeal, which gives it a delicious crispy edge when cooked. In 2016, peameal bacon on a roll was officially declared Toronto&rsquo;s signature dish! 😋</p>

  Toronto&rsquo;s Famous Musician: Glenn Gould 🎹🎶
  <a class="anchor" href="#torontos-famous-musician-glenn-gould-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Toronto was home to one of the world&rsquo;s greatest piano players, Glenn Gould. Born in Toronto in 1932, Glenn was a classical music superstar who played the piano in a very unique way. 🎼 He was especially famous for playing music by a composer named Johann Sebastian Bach.</p>
<p>Glenn Gould was so important to music that there are special places all around Toronto dedicated to him, including a statue where you can sit on a bench next to him. 🚶‍♂️🎹 There&rsquo;s also a music studio named after him at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre. Glenn&rsquo;s piano playing was so special that people still listen to his recordings today, more than 40 years after he died in 1982. 📀🎵</p>

  Toronto&rsquo;s Amazing Scientists: Banting and Best 🥼🔬
  <a class="anchor" href="#torontos-amazing-scientists-banting-and-best-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In 1921, something incredible happened at the University of Toronto. Dr. Frederick Banting and his assistant Charles Best made one of the most important medical discoveries ever - they found insulin, which is used to treat diabetes. 💉🧬</p>
<p>Before their discovery, diabetes was a fatal disease that couldn&rsquo;t be treated. On January 11, 1922, a 14-year-old boy named Leonard Thompson became the first person in the world to receive insulin as a treatment. This discovery saved millions of lives and earned Banting a Nobel Prize in medicine. 🏆</p>
<p>The work these scientists did in Toronto changed medicine forever and continues to help people with diabetes all around the world today! 🌍❤️</p>

  Fun Facts About Toronto 💡🗺️
  <a class="anchor" href="#fun-facts-about-toronto-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Did you know that the name &ldquo;Toronto&rdquo; comes from a Mohawk word &ldquo;tkaronto,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;where there are trees standing in the water&rdquo;? Long before it was a big city, Indigenous peoples had been living in the Toronto area for more than 10,000 years. 🌲🌊</p>
<p>Another cool fact is that Toronto is so diverse that it&rsquo;s often called the most multicultural city in the world! 🌎 People from more than 200 different ethnic origins live there, and about half of Toronto&rsquo;s residents were born in other countries. ✈️</p>
<p>Toronto is also one of the safest big cities in North America and has been used as a filming location for hundreds of movies and TV shows - sometimes even pretending to be New York City or Chicago! 🎥🎬</p>
<p>From its towering CN Tower to its delicious foods and amazing people, Toronto is truly one of the most exciting cities to explore in all of Canada! 🗼🍁🌟</p>
