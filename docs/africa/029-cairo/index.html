<p>The most famous sight near Cairo is definitely the Great Pyramids of Giza. These enormous ancient structures were built more than 4,500 years ago as tombs for Egyptian pharaohs (kings). The Great Pyramid is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and the only one still standing today. 🏆 It was built for Pharaoh Khufu and is so big that scientists still aren&rsquo;t completely sure how the ancient Egyptians built it without modern machines! The Great Sphinx, a huge statue with the body of a lion and the head of a human, guards these pyramids. 🦁</p>
