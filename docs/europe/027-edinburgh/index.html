<p>Edinburgh is a fascinating city with ancient castles, extinct volcanoes 🌋, and many amazing stories to discover! As Scotland&rsquo;s capital city, Edinburgh is full of history, culture, and exciting places to explore. Let&rsquo;s take a journey through this wonderful city and discover what makes it so special.</p>
<h2 id="where-is-edinburgh-">
  Where Is Edinburgh? 📍
  <a class="anchor" href="#where-is-edinburgh-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Edinburgh is located in southeast Scotland, in the United Kingdom. The city is built along the southern shore of a large inlet of the North Sea called the Firth of Forth 🌊. To the south of the city are the beautiful Pentland Hills ⛰️. Edinburgh sits in the Scottish Lowlands, which means it&rsquo;s in the less mountainous part of Scotland, but the city itself is quite hilly with many ups and downs as you walk around it.</p>
<p>Unlike many flat cities, Edinburgh was built around and on top of hills and even extinct volcanoes! This gives the city a unique appearance with buildings rising up at different levels, creating a dramatic skyline that looks like something from a storybook 📖.</p>
<h2 id="edinburgh-castle-a-fortress-on-a-volcano-">
  Edinburgh Castle: A Fortress on a Volcano 🏯
  <a class="anchor" href="#edinburgh-castle-a-fortress-on-a-volcano-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The most amazing sight in Edinburgh has to be Edinburgh Castle! This enormous castle sits high above the city on top of Castle Rock, which is actually a 700-million-year-old extinct volcano 🌋. From its position 443 feet (135 meters) above sea level, the castle looks down over the entire city, making it look like something from a fairy tale 🧚‍♀️.</p>
<p>People have lived on Castle Rock for at least 3,000 years! The first king to make his home here was King Malcolm III, who lived in the castle more than 900 years ago. The castle contains St. Margaret&rsquo;s Chapel, built between 1130 and 1140, which is the oldest building in all of Edinburgh that&rsquo;s still standing today.</p>
