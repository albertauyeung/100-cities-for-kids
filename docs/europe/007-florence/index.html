If you look at a map of Italy, you&rsquo;ll find Florence about 65 miles south of Bologna and 190 miles southeast of Milan.

</h2>
<p>About 367,150 people call Florence home as of 2022. That&rsquo;s about the same as a medium-sized city! The people of Florence speak Italian and are proud of their Tuscan heritage. 🇮🇹</p>
<h2 id="the-amazing-duomo-">
  The Amazing Duomo ⛪
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-amazing-duomo-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If you visit Florence, you absolutely must see the Florence Cathedral, also called the Duomo. It&rsquo;s the city&rsquo;s most famous landmark – kind of like how the Eiffel Tower is to Paris. The cathedral has a massive dome designed by an architect named Filippo Brunelleschi. Inside, you&rsquo;ll find beautiful stained-glass windows, detailed frescoes (paintings done on wet plaster), and a gorgeous mosaic floor. The cathedral is so big that it measures 153 meters long and 116 meters tall! 🌟</p>
<h2 id="yummy-food-">
  Yummy Food! 🍽️
  <a class="anchor" href="#yummy-food-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Florence&rsquo;s food comes from simple cooking traditions rather than fancy recipes. Florentines love their meat dishes! A special treat is the &ldquo;bistecca alla fiorentina,&rdquo; which is a huge steak cooked over hot charcoal. They also make delicious soups like &ldquo;ribollita&rdquo; and &ldquo;pappa al pomodoro,&rdquo; both served with local olive oil. Another favorite is &ldquo;panzanella,&rdquo; a summer salad made with bread and fresh vegetables. 🥩🍲🥗</p>

  A Famous Musician: Luigi Cherubini 🎼🎻
  <a class="anchor" href="#a-famous-musician-luigi-cherubini-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Florence has been home to many incredible artists and musicians. One of the most important was Luigi Cherubini, born in Florence in 1760. He wrote beautiful music including operas and church music. He was so talented that Ludwig van Beethoven (another famous composer) considered him the greatest composer of his time! The music conservatory (a special school for musicians) in Florence is named after him. 🎶</p>

  A Special Scientist: Florence Nightingale 🏥📊
  <a class="anchor" href="#a-special-scientist-florence-nightingale-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Did you know that Florence Nightingale was actually born in Florence, Italy? Her parents named her after the city! She became a famous nurse who changed how hospitals work. She was also amazing at math and used statistics (a type of math that deals with collecting and analyzing data) to save lives by improving healthcare. She created special diagrams to show important information in pictures, which helped convince people to make hospitals cleaner and safer. 🩺</p>
<h2 id="fun-fact-">
  Fun Fact 🎹
  <a class="anchor" href="#fun-fact-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something cool: The piano was invented in Florence! A man named Bartolomeo Cristofori created the first piano (then called a &ldquo;pianoforte&rdquo;) in 1698 while working for the Medici family who ruled Florence. Before this invention, people played instruments like the harpsichord, but the piano could play both soft and loud notes, which was revolutionary! 🎵</p>
<p>Florence is truly a magical city filled with art, history, and culture. Maybe someday you&rsquo;ll get to visit and see all these wonderful things for yourself! ✈️🌟</p>
