<p>Rome is one of the most famous and historic cities in the world! 🌍 Located in central Italy, this amazing city has thousands of years of history and fascinating things to discover. Let&rsquo;s explore the wonderful city of Rome together! 🇮🇹</p>
<h2 id="where-in-the-world-is-rome-">
  Where in the World is Rome? 🌍
  <a class="anchor" href="#where-in-the-world-is-rome-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Rome is located in the central part of Italy, in a region called Lazio. 🗺️ If you look at a map, you&rsquo;ll find Rome at these coordinates: 41.9028° North, 12.4964° East. The city sits on the banks of the Tiber River, which flows right through the middle of Rome. 🌊</p>
<p>One interesting geographic fact is that Rome was built on seven hills! 🌄 These hills are called the Aventine Hill, Capitoline Hill, Viminal Hill, Palatine Hill, Quirinal Hill, Esquiline Hill, and Caelian Hill. Rome is not directly on the sea, but it&rsquo;s less than 20 miles from the Tyrrhenian Sea, which is part of the Mediterranean. 🌊🗺️</p>
<h2 id="the-amazing-colosseum-">
  The Amazing Colosseum 🏟️
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-amazing-colosseum-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If you visit Rome, one place you absolutely must see is the Colosseum! 🏟️ This massive ancient building is one of the most famous structures in the world. 🌎</p>
<p>The Colosseum is a giant amphitheater (like a stadium) that was built nearly 2,000 years ago, between 70 and 80 CE. It&rsquo;s huge! When it was being used in ancient times, it could hold between 50,000 and 80,000 people. That&rsquo;s as many people as can fit in some modern football stadiums! 🏈</p>
<p>In ancient Rome, the Colosseum was used for exciting (but often violent) entertainment, including gladiator fights and mock naval battles when they would flood the arena with water. ⚔️🚢 Today, the Colosseum is partly ruined due to earthquakes and stone robbers over the centuries, but it&rsquo;s still an incredible sight and one of Rome&rsquo;s most popular tourist attractions. 📸</p>

</h2>
<p>Rome is a big city! 🌆 In fact, it&rsquo;s the largest and most populous city in all of Italy. As of 2025, approximately 2.75 million people live in the city of Rome itself. 👥 If you count all the surrounding areas (the metropolitan area), that number grows to about 4.3 million people. 📈</p>
<p>The population of Rome has been growing slowly in recent years. Between 2024 and 2025, the population increased by 0.35%. 📊</p>

  What Language Do Romans Speak and What Do They Eat? 🍝
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-language-do-romans-speak-and-what-do-they-eat-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>People in Rome speak Italian, which is the official language of Italy. 🇮🇹 In ancient times, people in Rome spoke Latin, which is actually the language that Italian eventually developed from. 📜</p>
<p>Rome is famous for its delicious food! 🍽️ One of the most important elements of Roman cuisine is pasta. Some famous Roman pasta dishes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cacio e pepe: pasta with cheese and black pepper 🧀🌶️</li>
<li>Carbonara: pasta with eggs, cheese, and guanciale (a type of bacon) 🍳🥓</li>
<li>Amatriciana: pasta with tomato sauce and guanciale 🍅🥓</li>
<li>Gricia: pasta with guanciale and cheese 🧀🥓</li>
</ul>
<p>Romans also enjoy other tasty foods like zucchini flowers filled with mozzarella and anchovies, which are battered and deep-fried. 🍴🧀 For dessert or on a hot day, you might try grattachecca, which is a type of shaved ice treat that&rsquo;s popular in Rome. 🍧</p>
