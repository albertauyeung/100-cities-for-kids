<ul>
<li>City: 莫斯科 (mok6 si1 fo1)</li>
<li>Country: 🇷🇺 俄羅斯 (ngo4 lo4 si1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Moscow is one of the world&rsquo;s most fascinating cities, and there&rsquo;s so much for young explorers to discover about Russia&rsquo;s incredible capital. This bustling metropolis sits right in the heart of Russia and has been an important city for nearly 900 years, making it a perfect place to learn about history, culture, and the amazing people who have called it home.</p>
<h2 id="where-is-moscow-located-">
  Where is Moscow Located? 📍🗺️
  <a class="anchor" href="#where-is-moscow-located-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Moscow is located in the western part of Russia, sitting proudly on the banks of the Moskva River. If you look at a map, you can find Moscow at coordinates 55°45′21″N 37°37′04″E, which places it in Central Russia. The city is about 400 miles southeast of another famous Russian city called St. Petersburg and about 300 miles east of the border with Belarus. Moscow covers a huge area of 2,511 square kilometers, making it one of the largest cities in the world by land area.</p>
<h2 id="the-amazing-red-square-">
  The Amazing Red Square 🟥🏰
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-amazing-red-square-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>One of the most spectacular places to visit in Moscow is the famous Red Square, which is like the heart of not just Moscow, but all of Russia. This enormous square is surrounded by incredible buildings that look like they came straight out of a fairy tale. The most famous building on Red Square is Saint Basil&rsquo;s Cathedral, which was built way back in the 1550s by a ruler named Ivan the Terrible. This cathedral is absolutely amazing to look at because it has nine separate chapels, each topped with its own colorful dome that&rsquo;s shaped differently from all the others. The domes are painted in bright reds, blues, greens, and golds, making the whole building look like something from a magical storybook. 🎨🏛️</p>
<h2 id="how-many-people-live-in-moscow-">
  How Many People Live in Moscow? 👥🏙️
  <a class="anchor" href="#how-many-people-live-in-moscow-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Moscow is home to an enormous number of people! In 2025, about 12.7 million people live within the city limits, which makes it the most populous city that is entirely in Europe. To put this in perspective, that&rsquo;s more people than live in many entire countries! If you include all the surrounding areas where people live and work, the total number grows to over 21.5 million people. The city has grown tremendously over the years - back in 1950, only about 5.4 million people lived there, so it has more than doubled in size.</p>

<p>The people of Moscow speak Russian, which uses a special alphabet called Cyrillic that looks quite different from the English alphabet. Russian is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, with over 253 million speakers globally. When it comes to food, Moscow offers some truly delicious dishes that have been enjoyed for centuries. One of the most famous foods is <strong>borscht</strong>, a beautiful purple soup made from beetroot that&rsquo;s popular throughout Eastern Europe. 🥣 Another favorite is <strong>pelmeni</strong>, which are small dumplings with super-thin dough stuffed with meat, onions, and herbs - they&rsquo;re like little pillows of deliciousness. 🥟 Moscow is also famous for <strong>blini</strong>, which are thin pancakes similar to crepes that can be eaten with sweet things like jam or savory items like caviar and sour cream. 🥞 Speaking of caviar, Moscow is one of the best places in the world to try this special delicacy, which comes from fish eggs and is considered very fancy. 🐟</p>

  Alexander Scriabin: The Musical Genius 🎹🎼
  <a class="anchor" href="#alexander-scriabin-the-musical-genius-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Moscow was the birthplace of Alexander Scriabin, one of Russia&rsquo;s most innovative composers and pianists. Born on January 6, 1872, Scriabin created music that was unlike anything anyone had heard before. He was initially inspired by the famous composer Frédéric Chopin, but later developed his own unique style that was much more adventurous and experimental. What made Scriabin really special was that he believed music could be connected to colors - he thought different musical notes should match different colors, and he even wanted to project colored lights during his concerts. 🎶🌈 He composed beautiful piano pieces and orchestral works, including something called the &ldquo;Poem of Ecstasy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Prometheus,&rdquo; which were meant to represent amazing spiritual journeys. Sadly, Scriabin died young at age 43 in 1915, but his music continues to amaze people around the world.</p>

</h2>
<p>Another remarkable person from Moscow was Andrei Sakharov, a brilliant physicist who was born in the city on May 21, 1921. Sakharov became one of the world&rsquo;s most important scientists, working on nuclear physics and helping to develop some of the most powerful scientific discoveries of the 20th century. But what made Sakharov truly special was that he wasn&rsquo;t just a great scientist - he was also a champion for human rights and peace. 🕊️✌️ He believed that science should be used to help humanity, not harm it, and he spent much of his life working to make the world a better place. In 1975, he won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to promote human rights and reduce the dangers of nuclear weapons. Even though the Soviet government sometimes disagreed with his ideas, Sakharov never stopped fighting for what he believed was right.</p>

  Boris Pasternak: The Beloved Writer ✍️📚
  <a class="anchor" href="#boris-pasternak-the-beloved-writer-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Moscow was also home to Boris Pasternak, one of Russia&rsquo;s greatest writers and poets. Born in Moscow on February 10, 1890, Pasternak came from a very artistic family - his father was a painter and his mother was a concert pianist. Pasternak became famous for writing beautiful poetry, but his most famous work was a novel called &ldquo;Doctor Zhivago,&rdquo; which tells the story of a doctor during the Russian Revolution and World War I. 📖 This book became incredibly popular around the world and was even made into a famous movie. 📽️ In 1958, Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, which is one of the highest honors a writer can receive. Unfortunately, the Soviet government at the time didn&rsquo;t approve of his book, so he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to accept the prize in person. However, his son was finally able to accept the award on his father&rsquo;s behalf many years later in 1989.</p>

  Amazing Fun Facts About Moscow 🌟🤔
  <a class="anchor" href="#amazing-fun-facts-about-moscow-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Moscow is full of surprising and wonderful facts that make it truly unique! First, Moscow is actually the northernmost and coldest megacity in the entire world, which means it gets much colder than any other city with more than 10 million people. During winter, temperatures can drop to about -10°C (14°F), and the city often gets covered in beautiful white snow. ❄️☃️ Another fascinating fact is that Moscow is sometimes called the &ldquo;City of Bridges&rdquo; because there are about 50 bridges spanning the Moskva River and its canals within the city limits. 🌉 The city is also incredibly green - over 40 percent of Moscow is covered by parks, forests, and other green spaces, making it one of the greenest major cities in Europe. 🌳 Perhaps most amazing of all is the Moscow Metro, the city&rsquo;s subway system, which is famous for having some of the most beautiful underground stations in the world. 🚇 These stations are decorated with gorgeous artwork, sculptures, and chandeliers, making them look more like underground palaces than train stations. Many people say riding the Moscow Metro is like visiting an underground art gallery!</p>
