<p>Sofia is the exciting capital city of Bulgaria, with a history going back thousands of years! 🏛️ Today, it&rsquo;s a modern city where old buildings and new ones stand side by side. 🏘️ If you&rsquo;re learning about world geography, 🌍 Sofia is definitely a place worth knowing about. It&rsquo;s filled with beautiful churches, ⛪ delicious foods 🍲, and has been home to many important people who have changed the world with their ideas and creations. 💡</p>
<h2 id="where-is-sofia-">
  Where is Sofia? 📍
  <a class="anchor" href="#where-is-sofia-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Sofia sits in a special valley called the Sofia Valley, at the foot of a mountain called Vitosha. 🏔️ It&rsquo;s located in the western part of Bulgaria, near the center of a region called the Balkans. What makes Sofia&rsquo;s location really neat is that it sits almost exactly in the middle between two seas - the Black Sea ⚫ and the Adriatic Sea. 🌊 It&rsquo;s also one of the highest capital cities in Europe! In fact, it&rsquo;s the second highest capital city in the European Union (after Madrid, Spain) and the third highest in all of Europe.</p>
<p>Unlike many capital cities that are built along big rivers, Sofia doesn&rsquo;t have a major river running through it. Instead, it has several smaller rivers that cross through the city. 🌊 The city is surrounded by beautiful mountains that you can see from almost anywhere in town. 🏞️</p>
<h2 id="amazing-places-to-see-">
  Amazing Places to See 🏰
  <a class="anchor" href="#amazing-places-to-see-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The most incredible building in Sofia is the Saint Alexander Nevsky Cathedral. ⛪ This massive church is one of Sofia&rsquo;s most important landmarks and a place that almost all tourists want to visit. It was built between 1904 and 1912 in a style called Neo-Byzantine, which means it looks a bit like ancient churches from long ago.</p>
<p>The cathedral is HUGE! It can hold 5,000 people inside at once and is one of the 50 largest Christian church buildings in the entire world. 🌍 It&rsquo;s also the largest cathedral in an area called the Balkans. When you step inside, you can look up at its beautiful domes that rise high above your head. 🌟 The main dome reaches 46.3 meters high (that&rsquo;s about as tall as a 15-story building)!</p>
<h2 id="the-people-of-sofia-">
  The People of Sofia 👥
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-people-of-sofia-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>About 1,286,000 people live in Sofia as of 2025. That&rsquo;s a lot of people! To help you imagine how many that is, think about filling about 17,000 school buses with people 🚌 - that&rsquo;s roughly how many people live in Sofia! The city is home to about 17.9% of Bulgaria&rsquo;s total population, which means about 1 out of every 6 Bulgarians lives in or around Sofia.</p>
<p>In recent years, Sofia&rsquo;s population has been pretty stable, with just a tiny decrease of about 0.16% from 2024 to 2025. 📉 This means that almost the same number of people live there now as did last year.</p>

  Bulgarian Language and Yummy Foods 🍽️
  <a class="anchor" href="#bulgarian-language-and-yummy-foods-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>People in Sofia speak Bulgarian, which uses a special alphabet called Cyrillic. 🗣️ Some simple Bulgarian phrases you might want to learn are &ldquo;Здрасти&rdquo; (pronounced &ldquo;zdrasti&rdquo;), which means &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; 👋 and &ldquo;благодаря&rdquo; (pronounced &ldquo;blagodarya&rdquo;), which means &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;. 🙏</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something funny: 🤭 Bulgarians shake their heads differently than people in most other countries! When they mean &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; they shake their heads from side to side (which is how many people indicate &ldquo;no&rdquo;). And when they mean &ldquo;no,&rdquo; they nod up and down (which is how many people usually say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;). This could get confusing if you visit! 🤔</p>
<p>Bulgarian food is delicious! 😋 One popular dish is Shopska Salad, which has tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, and a special Bulgarian white cheese called sirene. 🥗 The salad has the same colors as the Bulgarian flag - white, green, and red! 🇧🇬 Another tasty treat is Banitsa, a cheesy pastry that many Bulgarians eat for breakfast. 🥐 They also love grilled meats called Kebapche, which are like small sausages made from beef and pork with special spices. 🍖</p>

<p>Triphon Silyanovski was an important composer and pianist who was born right here in Sofia on December 16, 1923. 🎹 He was very talented and studied both music and law! 🏛️ He was a wonderful piano player and won the first Bulgarian Singers&rsquo; and Instrumentalists&rsquo; Competition. Triphon composed many different kinds of music including symphonies (music for a whole orchestra) and music for piano. 🎶 His music often included special melodies that sounded like traditional Orthodox church songs.</p>

<p>Georgi Nadjakov was a famous Bulgarian physicist who lived in Sofia. 🧪 He was so smart and made such important discoveries that he was invited to be a member of science academies in Bulgaria, Germany, and Russia! His biggest achievement was discovering something called a &ldquo;photoelectret&rdquo; in 1937. This might sound complicated, but his discovery actually helped lead to the invention of something you probably see almost every day - the photocopier! 📠 That&rsquo;s right, when your teacher makes copies of worksheets, they&rsquo;re using technology that came from Georgi Nadjakov&rsquo;s work.</p>
