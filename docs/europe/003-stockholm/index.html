<p>In 2025, about 1.7 million people call Stockholm home. This makes it the largest city in Sweden. The city has grown a lot over time - back in 1950, only about 741,082 people lived there. Today, Stockholm is busy and lively with people from all over Sweden and many other countries too! 🌍</p>

  The Amazing Vasa Museum 🚢
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-amazing-vasa-museum-">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If you visit Stockholm, you absolutely must see the Vasa Museum! This is one of the coolest museums in all of Scandinavia. Inside is a giant 17th-century warship called the Vasa that sank in 1628 on its very first voyage - before it even left Stockholm&rsquo;s harbor!</p>
<p>The most amazing part? After sitting underwater for 333 years, scientists found the ship and brought it back up to the surface. Now you can see this massive wooden ship up close, along with exhibitions showing what life was like for sailors in the 1600s. You can even see skeletons of some of the crew members and learn about what they ate and wore. ⚓</p>

</h2>
<p>In Stockholm, people speak Swedish. If you visit, you might hear people saying &ldquo;Hej&rdquo; (pronounced &ldquo;hey&rdquo;), which means &ldquo;hello&rdquo;! 👋</p>
<p>Sweden&rsquo;s most famous food is Swedish meatballs, called &ldquo;köttbullar&rdquo; in Swedish. These tasty meatballs are made from beef and pork mixed with special spices like nutmeg and allspice. They&rsquo;re usually served with creamy gravy, mashed potatoes, lingonberries (which are a bit like cranberries), and pickled cucumber. It&rsquo;s a delicious meal that many Swedish children love! 😋</p>
