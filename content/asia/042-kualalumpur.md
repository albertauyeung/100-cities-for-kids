## Where Is Kuala Lumpur Located?

Kuala Lumpur sits on the western side of the Malay Peninsula 🏝️ at about 3.1 degrees north of the Equator and 101.7 degrees east of the Prime Meridian. This means KL is near the equator, giving it a warm, tropical climate 🌞 with lots of rain 🌧️ throughout the year. The city is built where two rivers, the Gombak and Klang 🌊, meet—a spot that once was a muddy riverbank and inspired the name “Kuala Lumpur,” which means “muddy estuary” in Malay. KL lies around 40 kilometers inland from the Strait of Malacca, a busy sea route 🚢 that connects the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. This central position has helped make KL a crossroads for traders, musicians, scientists, and travelers from all over the world. 🌐✈️
