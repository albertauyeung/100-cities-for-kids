# Tehran, Iran

- City: 德黑蘭 (dak1 hak1 laan4)
- Country: 🇮🇷 伊朗 (ji1 long5)

Tehran, the vibrant capital of Iran, sits at the foot of the towering Alborz Mountains ⛰️. This bustling city blends ancient history 🏺 with modern energy ⚡, making it a fascinating place to explore!

## Population and Growth 📈

Did you know that Tehran is home to almost 10 million people? As of 2025, the population is estimated at 9,730,000. That's a lot of people! In fact, Tehran has grown tremendously over time. Back in 1950, only about 1 million people lived there. Today, Tehran is not only the largest city in Iran but also the 30th largest city in the world 🌍.

## Amazing Place to Visit: Golestan Palace 🏰

One of Tehran’s most spectacular sights is **Golestan Palace**, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Built over 400 years ago during the Safavid dynasty, this palace became the heart of Iran’s government when the Qajar dynasty chose Tehran as the capital in 1794. Imagine walking through gardens filled with pools and fruit trees 🌳, surrounded by dazzling buildings decorated with mosaics, paintings, and mirrored walls!

The **Marble Throne Hall** is the oldest part of the palace. Here, kings once sat on a shimmering throne carved from yellow marble, surrounded by intricate carvings of flowers 🌸 and mythical creatures. Another highlight is **Shams-ol Emareh** ("Edifice of the Sun"), a towering 19th-century building with stained-glass windows and balconies that offer panoramic views of Tehran. The palace also showcases a unique mix of Persian and European art, like oil paintings of Qajar rulers next to traditional Persian tilework.

Golestan Palace isn’t just a museum—it was a hub for artists, poets 📜, and photographers. In fact, it housed Iran’s first photography studio! Today, its eight museums let visitors step back in time, exploring everything from royal costumes 👑 to ancient manuscripts.

## Language and Food 🍽️

People in Tehran speak Persian (also called Farsi). When it comes to food, Tehran offers some truly delicious dishes! One famous Persian food is "Khoresht-e Fesenjan," a tasty stew made with pomegranate and walnuts. It's often served at wedding celebrations 👰. Another popular dish is "Zereshk Polo," which is rice with sweet-sour barberries and chicken.

## Famous People from Tehran 🎭

### Hossein Alizadeh: Master of Persian Music 🎶

Tehran is home to incredible artists like **Hossein Alizadeh**, a world-famous musician born here in 1951. As a child, he fell in love ❤️ with traditional Persian instruments like the **tar** (a long-necked lute) and **setar** (a smaller, delicate string instrument). He studied with legendary masters and later blended these ancient sounds with modern styles.

Alizadeh’s music tells stories of Persian history and nature. His album *Endless Vision* earned a Grammy nomination in 2006 🏆, and he’s performed everywhere from Paris to Tokyo. He also composed music for award-winning films like *Gabbeh*, which showcases Iran’s vibrant textile art. Beyond performing, Alizadeh teaches and mentors young musicians, ensuring Persian classical music stays alive.

### Maryam Mirzakhani: The Math Genius 📐
