# New Delhi, India

- City: 新德里 (san1 dak1 lei5)
- Country: 🇮🇳 印度 (jan3 dou6)

New Delhi is one of the most exciting and colorful cities in the world! 🌈 It's the capital of India, which means it's where the country's government works, just like Washington D.C. is the capital of the United States. 🏛️ This incredible city is home to millions of people and has been an important place for thousands of years. 👥

## Where is New Delhi Located? 📍

New Delhi is located in northern India, sitting right in the middle of the country. 🗺️ If you look at a map, you can find it at coordinates 28°36′50″N 77°12′32″E. The city sits on the west bank of the Yamuna River, which is a very important river in India. 🌊 New Delhi is surrounded by two states called Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The city is built on mostly flat land called the Indo-Gangetic Plain, but there are some small hills called the Delhi Ridge that used to be part of the Aravalli Mountains. ⛰️

What makes New Delhi's location special is that it's been chosen as a capital city many times throughout history because it sits right in the center of northern India, making it easy to reach from many different places. 🚦 The city was actually planned and built by British architects named Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, and it officially became India's capital in 1931. 🏗️

## India Gate: A Special Monument 🇮🇳

One of the most famous places to visit in New Delhi is called India Gate. This amazing monument looks just like the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France! 🏛️ India Gate is 42 meters tall (that's about as tall as a 14-story building). 🏢 It was built to remember the brave Indian soldiers who fought in World War I and other wars between 1914 and 1919. 🪖

The monument has the names of over 13,516 soldiers carved into it. At the bottom of India Gate, there are four eternal flames that burn all day and all night to honor soldiers who died protecting India. 🔥 The area around India Gate has beautiful green lawns where families love to have picnics, especially in the evenings when the monument is lit up with colorful lights. 🌟 It's like a giant park right in the middle of the city! 🌳

## How Many People Live There? 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

New Delhi is a very crowded and busy place! 🏙️ The New Delhi district itself has about 1,173,902 people living in it, which is about 8% of all the people who live in the bigger Delhi area. But if you count the entire National Capital Territory of Delhi (which includes both Old Delhi and New Delhi), there are about 16.8 million people living there. That's more people than live in the entire country of Netherlands! 🇳🇱

The population density is very high - about 10,000 people per square kilometer. This means New Delhi is one of the most crowded cities in the world. 🚶‍♂️ Most people in New Delhi can read and write - the literacy rate is 88.01%, which is the highest in the Delhi area. 📚

## Language and Amazing Food 🍽️

The people of New Delhi speak Hindi and English as their main languages. 📖 Hindi is written in a special script called Devanagari, which looks very different from English letters. ✍️ Many kids in New Delhi learn both Hindi and English in school, so they can speak two languages fluently! 🎓

The food in New Delhi is absolutely delicious and very different from what you might eat at home. 🥘 Some popular street foods include aloo tikki (spiced potato patties), dahi bhalla (fried lentil balls in yogurt), and parathas (stuffed flatbreads). There are also kachoris, which are crispy fried breads stuffed with beans and topped with tangy sauces. For dessert, people love kulfi, which is like a very thick and sweet ice cream. 🍦 Many of these foods are sold by street vendors in the old parts of the city, especially in an area called Chandni Chowk. 🛍️

## Famous Classical Musician: Ravi Shankar 🎶

New Delhi was home to one of the world's most famous classical musicians, Ravi Shankar. He played an instrument called the sitar, which is like a guitar but with many more strings and a very different sound. 🎸 Ravi Shankar was so talented that he became the world's best-known expert on Indian classical music in the 1900s. From 1949 to 1956, he worked as the music director of All India Radio in New Delhi, where he helped bring Indian music to people all over the country. 📻

What made Ravi Shankar extra special was that he helped introduce Indian music to musicians in other countries, including George Harrison from the famous band The Beatles. 🎤 He even worked on the music for movies and was awarded India's highest civilian honor, called the Bharat Ratna, in 1999. 🏆 His music influenced musicians all around the world and helped people everywhere learn about India's beautiful classical music traditions. 🌍

## Famous Scientist: Charusita Chakravarty 🔬

New Delhi was also home to an amazing scientist named Charusita Chakravarty.

She studied how tiny particles called molecules move and behave, which helped other scientists understand chemistry better. 🧪 What's really inspiring about Dr. Chakravarty is that she chose to give up her American citizenship when she was young because she wanted to live and work in India. 🇺🇸➡️🇮🇳 She dedicated her life to teaching and doing research that helped make the world a better place through science. 🌟

## Fun Facts About New Delhi 🤩

Here are some amazing fun facts about New Delhi that will surprise you! First, the city has a very unique building called the Lotus Temple that's shaped exactly like a giant lotus flower. 🌸 It's made of white marble and has 27 "petals" that make it look like it's floating. The temple is so beautiful that it has won many architecture awards! 🏆

Another cool fact is that New Delhi experiences some pretty extreme weather. 🌡️ The hottest temperature ever recorded there was 49.9°C (121.8°F) in May 2024, while the coldest was -2.2°C (28.0°F) in 1967. 🔥❄️ That's a difference of over 50 degrees Celsius! The city also sits in an earthquake zone, so it sometimes experiences small earthquakes. 🌍

One more fascinating thing about New Delhi is that it's actually much newer than Old Delhi. While Old Delhi has been around for hundreds of years, New Delhi was only officially opened in 1931 when the British decided to move India's capital from Calcutta (now Kolkata) to Delhi. 🕰️ The British wanted to build a completely new, modern city with wide, tree-lined streets and lots of green spaces, which is why New Delhi looks so different from the narrow, winding streets of Old Delhi. 🌳🏛️

New Delhi is truly one of the world's most fascinating cities, where ancient history meets modern life every day. From its strategic location in the heart of India to its incredible monuments like India Gate, from its delicious street food to its world-famous musicians, scientists, and authors, New Delhi offers something amazing around every corner.
