# Hong Kong, China

- City: 香港 (hoeng1 gong2)
- Country: 🇨🇳 中國 (zung1 gwok3)

Hong Kong is a fascinating city located in Eastern Asia, right at the mouth of the Pearl River Delta and bordering the South China Sea. It is a special administrative region (SAR) of China and shares a land border with the Chinese mainland, just north of the large city of Shenzhen.

Hong Kong is made up of three main parts: Hong Kong Island, Kowloon Peninsula, and the New Territories, plus more than 260 smaller islands. Most of the land is hilly or mountainous, with the highest point being Tai Mo Shan at 957 meters (3,140 feet). ⛰️

## Where All the People Live 👥🏢

About 7.7 million people live in Hong Kong as of 2024, making it one of the most crowded places in the world. Even though it is about six times the size of Washington, D.C., or half the size of Mauritius, so many people live there that the city is packed with tall buildings and busy streets. The heart of Hong Kong is the urban area around Victoria (on Hong Kong Island) and Kowloon, which are filled with dazzling skyscrapers, especially beautiful when lit up at night. 🌇

## Languages and Yummy Food 🥢🍜

Most people in Hong Kong speak Cantonese, a Chinese language common in southern China, but English is also an official language due to Hong Kong's history as a British colony. The city is famous for its delicious food, especially dim sum—small, tasty dishes served in bamboo steamers that you can share with family and friends! 🥟🍽️

## A Special Place to Visit: Tai Kwun 🏛️🎨

Tai Kwun is a remarkable cultural landmark in Central, Hong Kong, housed in the beautifully restored former Central Police Station compound. It brings together three declared monuments: the Central Police Station, Central Magistracy, and Victoria Prison, all thoughtfully revitalized to preserve their historical significance. Today, Tai Kwun serves as a dynamic hub for heritage, art exhibitions, and performing arts, offering interactive experiences for visitors of all ages. Children can explore old prison cells, learn about Hong Kong’s colonial past, and enjoy hands-on art and cultural workshops. The site also hosts regular festivals and community events, making it a lively and inclusive space to experience Hong Kong’s unique blend of East and West. Tai Kwun’s commitment to local culture and history, combined with its modern art and community spirit, makes it one of the most culturally representative places to visit in the city. 🎭👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
