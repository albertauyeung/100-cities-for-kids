## Where Is Ontario? 📍

Ontario is located right in the heart of Canada! 
Ontario shares borders with Manitoba to the west and Quebec to the east. To the north, it touches Hudson Bay and James Bay. To the south, Ontario borders the U.S. states of Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York.
 
Ontario covers one million square kilometres. This makes it larger than Spain and France combined! Ontario is the second-largest province in Canada, coming in behind Quebec.


The province is so big that 
if it were a country, it would be the 28th largest one in the world.
 That's enormous! Ontario sits next to the famous Great Lakes, and 
Ontario is also the starting point of the Saint Lawrence River, the largest in Canada by drainage volume, which flows from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic.


## How Many People Live There? 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

Ontario is home to lots and lots of people! 
As of July 1, 2025, Ontario's population reached 16,258,260
 - that's more than 16 million people! To put that in perspective, 
Ontario is home to almost four in every ten (38.45% in 2021) Canadians.
 


Ontario is the largest province in Canada, and Canada's richest province. Toronto, the largest city in Ontario is also the largest city in Canada.
 
Toronto is the capital of Ontario and is the largest city in Canada with over 3 million residents. Almost 25% of Canada's population lives within a 160 km radius of Toronto.


Here's something really cool: 
95% of Ontario's population live in Southern Ontario, which occupies only 13% of the province's total land.
 That means most people live in the warmer, southern part of the province!

## Special Places to See 🏛️

The CN Tower, an iconic symbol of Toronto, is another must-see landmark that offers unmatched city views. Standing 553 metres tall, it was once the tallest freestanding structure in the world and still stands as one of the tallest towers globally.

 You can even walk around the outside edge of the tower in an activity called EdgeWalk - how exciting is that!

Niagara Falls is undoubtedly one of the most famous natural landmarks in the world. Located on the border between Ontario and New York, this incredible waterfall draws millions of visitors yearly.
 
For an immersive experience, take a boat ride on the Maid of the Mist, which brings you up close to the falls for an unforgettable, drenched experience.

## Language and Food 🗣️🍽️

People in Ontario speak many different languages! 
There are over 140 languages and dialects spoken in Toronto and 44% of residents have a first language that isn't English or French.
 
Although the whole country is technically bilingual, the majority of French-speakers are concentrated in the east of the country - including Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Quebec
 - but English is the main language most people speak in Ontario.

When it comes to food, Ontario has some delicious treats! 
Maclean's 2017 survey of "favourite iconic Canadian food" placed poutine first with 21% of respondents, ahead of maple syrup with 14%.
 Poutine is 
crispy french fries topped with squeaky cheese curds and smothered in rich gravy. The combination of textures and flavors is simply irresistible, making poutine a beloved comfort food across the country.



Of course, maple syrup is perhaps the biggest Canadian foodie traditions—it can't get more traditional than pure maple syrup extracted from forests across Canada. Pure Maple Syrup is used in plenty of recipes and suitable for every season. All four grades are 100% natural products that are perfect for adding a bit of sweetness to many favourite dishes and recipes.
