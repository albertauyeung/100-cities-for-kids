# Oslo, Norway

- City: 奧斯陸 (ou3 si1 luk6)
- Country: 🇳🇴 挪威 (no4 wai1)

## Where is Oslo Located? 📍

Oslo is the capital city of Norway 🇳🇴, a beautiful country in Northern Europe. Think of it like this: if you look at a map 🗺️ of Europe and find the top part that looks like it reaches toward the North Pole, that's Scandinavia, and Norway is on the western side of it! Oslo sits in the southeastern part of Norway, right at the end of a special water feature called the Oslofjord. It's like the city is sitting at the very tip of a long finger of ocean water 🌊 that stretches into the land.

The city has special coordinates on Earth: 59.91° North latitude and 10.75° East longitude. Oslo is surrounded by green forests 🌲, hills, and mountains 🏔️, making it look like a natural amphitheater. There are even 40 islands 🏝️ within the city limits and 343 lakes!

## A Special Place to Visit: Vigeland Sculpture Park 🎨

One of the most amazing places in Oslo is the **Vigeland Sculpture Park**. This isn't just any ordinary park - it's the world's largest sculpture park created by a single artist! 🗿

The park contains more than 200 incredible sculptures made by a Norwegian artist named Gustav Vigeland. All the sculptures show people 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 - men, women, and children of all ages - carved from granite, cast in bronze, and made from wrought iron. The most famous sculpture is called "The Monolith," which is a huge column carved from a single block of stone with 121 human figures climbing up it. There's also a funny sculpture called "The Angry Boy" (Sinnataggen in Norwegian) that has become one of Oslo's most famous symbols.

The best part? The park is completely free to visit and open 24 hours a day, every day of the year! ⏰ You can walk around and see all these amazing sculptures that tell stories about human life.

## How Many People Live in Oslo? 👥

Oslo is a pretty big city! As of 2025, about **1,115,580 people** live in the greater Oslo area. The city itself (just Oslo municipality) has about **724,290 people**. That's like having more than seven hundred thousand neighbors! 🏘️

Oslo is growing fast - it's been called the fastest-growing Scandinavian capital. Every year, more people move to Oslo because it's such a great place to live. About 33% of Oslo's population are either immigrants or people born to immigrant parents, making it a very international and diverse city. 🌍

## Language and Food 🗣️🍽️

In Oslo, people speak **Norwegian**, which is the official language of Norway. Norwegian has some special letters that English doesn't have, like å, æ, and ø. Many people in Oslo also speak excellent English, so visitors from around the world can easily communicate.

When it comes to food, Oslo has some very special Norwegian dishes! Here are some traditional foods you might try:

- **Waffles** 🧇 with brown goat cheese, jam, or sour cream - these are heart-shaped and absolutely delicious!
- **Pölse i lompe** - a hot dog 🌭 wrapped in a special soft potato flatbread called lompe
- **Fresh prawns** 🍤 (shrimp) caught right from the Oslofjord and cooked on boats
- **Brown cheese** (brunost) - a sweet, caramel-colored cheese 🧀 that's uniquely Norwegian
- **Meatballs** (kjøttkaker) served with potatoes and gravy

The city also has amazing fresh seafood 🐟 since it's right by the water, and you can even buy freshly cooked prawns directly from fishing boats at the harbor! 🚤

## A Famous Classical Music Composer: Rikard Nordraak 🎶

One of Oslo's most important musical figures was **Rikard Nordraak** (1842-1866). Even though he lived a very short life - only 23 years - he created something that every Norwegian knows by heart: the music for Norway's national anthem, "Ja, vi elsker dette landet" (Yes, We Love This Country).

Rikard was born and grew up right in Oslo. He was supposed to become a businessman, but his love for music was too strong. When he was just 15, he was sent to Copenhagen to study business, but instead he ended up studying music! 🎼 He wrote the melody for Norway's national anthem when he was only in his early twenties, and it was first performed publicly on May 17, 1864, during Norway's Constitution Day celebration. 🇳🇴

Sadly, Rikard died very young from tuberculosis 😔 while studying in Berlin, Germany. But his beautiful music lives on and is sung by millions of Norwegians every year on their national day!

## A Famous Scientist: Fridtjof Nansen 🌍🔬

Oslo was home to one of the world's most amazing explorers and scientists: **Fridtjof Nansen** (1861-1930). He was born near Oslo and became famous for being the first person to cross the interior of Greenland on skis in 1888. 🎿

But Nansen's greatest adventure was even more incredible! He built a special ship 🚢 called the *Fram* and deliberately got it frozen in the Arctic ice ❄️. His plan was to let the ice carry the ship across the North Pole - like riding on a giant, slow-moving ice raft! During this expedition from 1893-1896, he and his team reached closer to the North Pole than anyone had ever been before.

Nansen wasn't just an explorer - he was also a brilliant scientist who studied ocean currents, marine biology, and even invented a special bottle that oceanographers still use today to collect water samples from deep in the ocean 🌊. Later in his life, he became a humanitarian worker helping refugees after World War I, and he won the Nobel Peace Prize 🏆 in 1922.

## A Famous Writer: Henrik Ibsen ✍️

One of the world's greatest playwrights lived his final years in Oslo: **Henrik Ibsen** (1828-1906). He's often called "the father of modern drama" and is considered the second most performed playwright in the world, right after William Shakespeare! 🎭

Ibsen wrote incredibly powerful plays that are still performed all over the world today. His most famous works include "A Doll's House," "Peer Gynt," "Hedda Gabler," and "An Enemy of the People". His plays were considered quite shocking when they were first written because they dealt with serious social problems and showed realistic family life, including its difficulties.

Although Ibsen was born in another Norwegian town called Skien, he moved back to Oslo (then called Christiania) in 1891 and lived there until he died in 1906. Today, you can visit the Henrik Ibsen Museum in Oslo, which was his last apartment, and you can even walk along the streets where he used to take his daily walks - they've put his famous quotes right into the pavement! 🏛️
