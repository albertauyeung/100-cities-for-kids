Edinburgh is a fascinating city with ancient castles, extinct volcanoes 🌋, and many amazing stories to discover! As Scotland's capital city, Edinburgh is full of history, culture, and exciting places to explore. Let's take a journey through this wonderful city and discover what makes it so special.

## Where Is Edinburgh? 📍

Edinburgh is located in southeast Scotland, in the United Kingdom. The city is built along the southern shore of a large inlet of the North Sea called the Firth of Forth 🌊. To the south of the city are the beautiful Pentland Hills ⛰️. Edinburgh sits in the Scottish Lowlands, which means it's in the less mountainous part of Scotland, but the city itself is quite hilly with many ups and downs as you walk around it.

Unlike many flat cities, Edinburgh was built around and on top of hills and even extinct volcanoes! This gives the city a unique appearance with buildings rising up at different levels, creating a dramatic skyline that looks like something from a storybook 📖.

## Edinburgh Castle: A Fortress on a Volcano 🏯

The most amazing sight in Edinburgh has to be Edinburgh Castle! This enormous castle sits high above the city on top of Castle Rock, which is actually a 700-million-year-old extinct volcano 🌋. From its position 443 feet (135 meters) above sea level, the castle looks down over the entire city, making it look like something from a fairy tale 🧚‍♀️.

People have lived on Castle Rock for at least 3,000 years! The first king to make his home here was King Malcolm III, who lived in the castle more than 900 years ago. The castle contains St. Margaret's Chapel, built between 1130 and 1140, which is the oldest building in all of Edinburgh that's still standing today.

Edinburgh Castle has seen a lot of exciting history - it's the most besieged place in Britain, having been attacked 23 times throughout history! Today, more than two million visitors come to see the castle every year 🏰.

## The People of Edinburgh 👥

Edinburgh is home to more than 514,000 people as of 2022. The city has become increasingly diverse over the years. While most residents are Scottish, many people from all over the world now call Edinburgh home 🌍.

In 2022, about 85% of Edinburgh's population was White (including Scottish, British, Irish, Polish and other European backgrounds), with growing Asian, Black, Mixed and other ethnic communities making up about 15% of the population. The city has changed a lot over time - in 1991, about 98% of the population was White, showing how Edinburgh has become more diverse and multicultural in recent decades.

## Language and Food 🍽️

The main language spoken in Edinburgh is English, which is the official language of Scotland. However, you might also hear Scottish Gaelic (pronounced "GAL-ik") and Scots, which are historical languages of Scotland that some people still speak today 🗣️.

Edinburgh has lots of delicious traditional foods to try! Some favorites include:

- Fish and Chips: Deep-fried cod or haddock with French fries, usually served with salt and vinegar 🐟🍟
