## Where in the World is São Paulo? 📍

São Paulo is located in the southeastern part of Brazil, which is the largest country in South America. 🌎 It sits about 220 miles (350 kilometers) southwest of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's other famous city. 🏖️ The city is about 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, so it's not directly on the beach, but it's not too far away either! 🌊 São Paulo is both the name of the city and the state it's in - kind of like how New York City is in New York State. 🗽

The city sits on a plateau at an elevation of around 799 meters (2,621 feet) above sea level, 🏔️ which means it's on higher ground than many coastal cities. Its exact location is at latitude 23°33'01'' south and longitude 46°38'02'' west, 📍 but don't worry about remembering those numbers - just know it's in the southern part of Brazil!

## Ibirapuera Park: A Super Special Place to Visit 🌳
